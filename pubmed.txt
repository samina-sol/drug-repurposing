TI  - Novel Therapeutic Approaches for Alzheimer's Disease: An Updated Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22158208 [doi]
LID - 8208
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and accounts 
      for most cases of dementia. The prevalence of AD has increased in the current 
      rapidly aging society and contributes to a heavy burden on families and society. 
      Despite the profound impact of AD, current treatments are unable to achieve 
      satisfactory therapeutic effects or stop the progression of the disease. Finding 
      novel treatments for AD has become urgent. In this paper, we reviewed novel 
      therapeutic approaches in five categories: anti-amyloid therapy, anti-tau 
      therapy, anti-neuroinflammatory therapy, neuroprotective agents including 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulators, and brain stimulation. The trend 
      of therapeutic development is shifting from a single pathological target to a 
      more complex mechanism, such as the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative 
      processes. While drug repositioning may accelerate pharmacological development, 
      non-pharmacological interventions, especially repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), also have 
      the potential for clinical application. In the future, it is possible for 
      physicians to choose appropriate interventions individually on the basis of 
      precision medicine.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning-aided drug discovery in central 
      nervous system diseases: State-of-the-arts and future directions.
PG  - 1427-1473
LID - 10.1002/med.21764 [doi]
AB  - Neurological disorders significantly outnumber diseases in other therapeutic 
      areas. However, developing drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders 
      remains the most challenging area in drug discovery, accompanied with the long 
      timelines and high attrition rates. With the rapid growth of biomedical data 
      enabled by advanced experimental technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and 
      machine learning (ML) have emerged as an indispensable tool to draw meaningful 
      insights and improve decision making in drug discovery. Thanks to the 
      advancements in AI and ML algorithms, now the AI/ML-driven solutions have an 
      unprecedented potential to accelerate the process of CNS drug discovery with 
      better success rate. In this review, we comprehensively summarize AI/ML-powered 
      pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementations in the CNS area. After 
      introducing the AI/ML models as well as the conceptualization and data 
      preparation, we outline the applications of AI/ML technologies to several key 
      procedures in drug discovery, including target identification, compound 
      screening, hit/lead generation and optimization, drug response and synergy 
      prediction, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. We review the current 
      state-of-the-art of AI/ML-guided CNS drug discovery, focusing on blood-brain 
      barrier permeability prediction and implementation into therapeutic discovery for 
      neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss the major challenges and limitations 
      of current approaches and possible future directions that may provide resolutions 
      to these difficulties.

AB  - It has been 15 years since the birth of human induced pluripotent stem cell 
      (iPSC) technology in 2007, and the scope of its application has been expanding. 
      In addition to the development of cell therapies using iPSC-derived cells, 
      pathological analyses using disease-specific iPSCs and clinical trials to confirm 
      the safety and efficacy of drugs developed using iPSCs are progressing. With the 
      innovation of related technologies, iPSC applications are about to enter a new 
      stage. This review outlines advances in iPSC modeling and therapeutic development 
      for cardinal neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
      Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Genetic Variation in Targets of Antidiabetic Drugs and Alzheimer Disease Risk: A 
      Mendelian Randomization Study.
PG  - e650-e659
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000200771 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have highlighted antidiabetic drugs 
      as repurposing candidates for Alzheimer disease (AD), but the disease-modifying 
      effects are still unclear. METHODS: A 2-sample mendelian randomization study 
      design was applied to examine the association between genetic variation in the 
      targets of 4 antidiabetic drug classes and AD risk. Genetic summary statistics 
      for blood glucose were analyzed using UK Biobank data of 326,885 participants, 
      whereas summary statistics for AD were retrieved from previous genome-wide 
      association studies comprising 24,087 clinically diagnosed AD cases and 55,058 
      controls. Positive control analysis on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), insulin 
      secretion, insulin resistance, and obesity-related traits was conducted to 
      validate the selection of instrumental variables. RESULTS: In the positive 
      control analysis, genetic variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with 
      higher insulin secretion, a lower risk of T2DM, and an increment in body mass 
      index, waist circumference, and hip circumference, consistent with drug 
      mechanistic actions and previous trial evidence. In the primary analysis, genetic 
      variation in sulfonylurea targets was associated with a lower risk of AD (odds 
      ratio [OR] = 0.38 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.19-0.72, p = 
      0.0034). These results for sulfonylureas were largely unchanged in the 
      sensitivity analysis using a genetic variant, rs757110, that has been validated 
      to modulate the target proteins of sulfonylureas (OR = 0.35 per 1 mmol/L 
      decrement in blood glucose, 95% CI 0.15-0.82, p = 0.016). An association between 
      genetic variations in the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue target and a 
      lower risk of AD was also observed (OR = 0.32 per 1 mmol/L decrement in blood 
      glucose, 95% CI 0.13-0.79, p = 0.014). However, this result should be interpreted 
      with caution because the positive control analyses for GLP-1 analogues did not 
      comply with a weight-loss effect as shown in previous clinical trials. Results 
      regarding other drug classes were inconclusive. DISCUSSION: Genetic variation in 
      sulfonylurea targets was associated with a lower risk of AD, and future studies 
      are warranted to clarify the underlying mechanistic pathways between 
      sulfonylureas and AD.

TI  - Endophenotype-based in silico network medicine discovery combined with insurance 
      record data mining identifies sildenafil as a candidate drug for Alzheimer's 
      disease.

AB  - We developed an endophenotype disease module-based methodology for Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) drug repurposing and identified sildenafil as a potential disease 
      risk modifier. Based on retrospective case-control pharmacoepidemiologic analyses 
      of insurance claims data for 7.23 million individuals, we found that sildenafil 
      usage was significantly associated with a 69% reduced risk of AD (hazard ratio = 
      0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.39, P<1.0×10(-8)). Propensity score 
      stratified analyses confirmed that sildenafil is significantly associated with a 
      decreased risk of AD across all four drug cohorts we tested (diltiazem, 
      glimepiride, losartan and metformin) after adjusting age, sex, race, and disease 
      comorbidities. We also found that sildenafil increases neurite growth and 
      decreases phospho-tau expression in AD patient-induced pluripotent stem 
      cells-derived neuron models, supporting mechanistically its potential beneficial 
      effect in Alzheimer's disease. The association between sildenafil use and 
      decreased incidence of AD does not establish causality or its direction, which 
      requires a randomized clinical trial approach.

AB  - Clinical trials of novel therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have consumed 
      a large amount of time and resources with largely negative results. Repurposing 
      drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for another 
      indication is a more rapid and less expensive option. We present DRIAD (Drug 
      Repurposing In AD), a machine learning framework that quantifies potential 
      associations between the pathology of AD severity (the Braak stage) and molecular 
      mechanisms as encoded in lists of gene names. DRIAD is applied to lists of genes 
      arising from perturbations in differentiated human neural cell cultures by 80 
      FDA-approved and clinically tested drugs, producing a ranked list of possible 
      repurposing candidates. Top-scoring drugs are inspected for common trends among 
      their targets. We propose that the DRIAD method can be used to nominate drugs 
      that, after additional validation and identification of relevant pharmacodynamic 
      biomarker(s), could be readily evaluated in a clinical trial.

AB  - Constructing disease-disease similarity network is important in elucidating the 
      associations between the origin and molecular mechanism of diseases, and in 
      researching disease function and medical research. In this paper, we use a 
      high-quality protein interaction network and a collection of pathway databases to 
      construct a Human Pathway-based Disease Network (HPDN) to explore the 
      relationship between diseases and their intrinsic interactions. We find that the 
      similarity of two diseases has a strong correlation with the number of their 
      shared functional pathways and the interaction between their related gene sets. 
      Comparing HPDN with disease networks based on genes and symptoms respectively, we 
      find the three networks have high overlap rates. Additionally, HPDN can predict 
      new disease-disease correlations, which are supported by Comparative 
      Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) benchmark and large-scale biomedical literature 
      database. The comprehensive, high-quality relations between diseases based on 
      pathways can further be applied to study important matters in systems medicine, 
      for instance, drug repurposing. Based on a dense subgraph in our network, we find 
      two drugs, prednisone and folic acid, may have new indications, which will 
      provide potential directions for the treatments of complex diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous 
      susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, utilizing GWAS and 
      multi-omics data to identify high-confidence AD risk genes (ARGs) and druggable 
      targets that can guide development of new therapeutics for patients suffering 
      from AD has heretofore not been successful. METHODS: To address this critical 
      problem in the field, we have developed a network-based artificial intelligence 
      framework that is capable of integrating multi-omics data along with human 
      protein-protein interactome networks to accurately infer accurate drug targets 
      impacted by GWAS-identified variants to identify new therapeutics. When applied 
      to AD, this approach integrates GWAS findings, multi-omics data from brain 
      samples of AD patients and AD transgenic animal models, drug-target networks, and 
      the human protein-protein interactome, along with large-scale patient database 
      validation and in vitro mechanistic observations in human microglia cells. 
      RESULTS: Through this approach, we identified 103 ARGs validated by various 
      levels of pathobiological evidence in AD. Via network-based prediction and 
      population-based validation, we then showed that three drugs (pioglitazone, 
      febuxostat, and atenolol) are significantly associated with decreased risk of AD 
      compared with matched control populations. Pioglitazone usage is significantly 
      associated with decreased risk of AD (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.916, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 0.861-0.974, P = 0.005) in a retrospective case-control validation. 
      Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist used 
      to treat type 2 diabetes, and propensity score matching cohort studies confirmed 
      its association with reduced risk of AD in comparison to glipizide (HR = 0.921, 
      95% CI 0.862-0.984, P = 0.0159), an insulin secretagogue that is also used to 
      treat type 2 diabetes. In vitro experiments showed that pioglitazone 
      downregulated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase 
      (CDK5) in human microglia cells, supporting a possible mechanism-of-action for 
      its beneficial effect in AD. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we present an integrated, 
      network-based artificial intelligence methodology to rapidly translate GWAS 
      findings and multi-omics data to genotype-informed therapeutic discovery in AD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia and 
      represents a huge burden for patients, carers, and healthcare systems. Extensive 
      efforts for over 20 years have failed to find effective disease-modifying drugs. 
      Although amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain predicts cognitive decline, 
      effective reduction of plaque load by numerous drug candidates has not yielded 
      significant clinical benefits. A similar pattern is now emerging for drugs which 
      target hyperphosphorylated tau, and trials with anti-inflammatory drugs have been 
      negative despite neuroinflammation appearing to have a crucial role in AD 
      pathogenesis. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews key drugs that have been 
      discontinued while in development for AD and delineates the future landscape for 
      present and alternative approaches. EXPERT OPINION: Anti-Aβ drugs have failed to 
      validate the Aβ cascade hypothesis of AD. Early findings suggest that the same is 
      happening with therapeutics targeting tau and focussing future research solely on 
      anti-tau drugs is inappropriate. Alternative targets should be pursued, including 
      apolipoprotein E, immunomodulation, plasma exchange, protein autophagy and 
      clearance, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal glucose metabolism, neurovascular 
      unit support, epigenetic dysregulation, synaptic loss and dysfunction, microbiota 
      dysbiosis, and combination therapies. Meanwhile, repurposing of drugs approved 
      for other indications is justified where scientific rationale and robust 
      preclinical evidence exist.

AB  - Copper homeostasis is tightly regulated in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells 
      to ensure sufficient amounts for cuproprotein biosynthesis, while limiting 
      oxidative stress production and toxicity. Over the last century, copper complexes 
      have been developed as antimicrobials and for treating diseases involving copper 
      dyshomeostasis (e.g., Wilson's disease). There now exists a repertoire of copper 
      complexes that can regulate bodily copper through a myriad of mechanisms. 
      Furthermore, many copper complexes are now being appraised for a variety of 
      therapeutic indications (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis) that require a range of copper-related pharmacological affects. Cancer 
      therapy is also drawing considerable attention since copper has been recognized 
      as a limiting factor for multiple aspects of cancer progression including growth, 
      angiogenesis, and metastasis. Consequently, 'old copper complexes' (e.g., 
      tetrathiomolybdate and clioquinol) have been repurposed for cancer therapy and 
      have demonstrated anticancer activity in vitro and in preclinical models. 
      Likewise, new tailor-made copper complexes have been designed based on structural 
      and biological features ideal for their anticancer activity. Human clinical 
      trials continue to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of copper complexes as 
      anticancer agents and considerable progress has been made in understanding their 
      pharmacological requirements. In this chapter, we present a historical 
      perspective on the main copper complexes that are currently being repurposed for 
      cancer therapy and detail several of the more recently developed compounds that 
      have emerged as promising anticancer agents. We further provide an overview of 
      the known mechanisms of action, including molecular targets and we discuss 
      associated clinical trials.

AB  - Translating human genetic findings (genome-wide association studies [GWAS]) to 
      pathobiology and therapeutic discovery remains a major challenge for Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). We present a network topology-based deep learning framework to 
      identify disease-associated genes (NETTAG). We leverage non-coding GWAS loci 
      effects on quantitative trait loci, enhancers and CpG islands, promoter regions, 
      open chromatin, and promoter flanking regions under the protein-protein 
      interactome. Via NETTAG, we identified 156 AD-risk genes enriched in druggable 
      targets. Combining network-based prediction and retrospective case-control 
      observations with 10 million individuals, we identified that usage of four drugs 
      (ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, cholecalciferol, and ceftriaxone) is associated with 
      reduced likelihood of AD incidence. Gemfibrozil (an approved lipid regulator) is 
      significantly associated with 43% reduced risk of AD compared with simvastatin 
      using an active-comparator design (95% confidence interval 0.51-0.63, 
      p < 0.0001). In summary, NETTAG offers a deep learning methodology that utilizes 
      GWAS and multi-genomic findings to identify pathobiology and drug repurposing in 
      AD.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) are two 
      common causes of death in elderly people, which includes progressive neuronal 
      cell death and behavioral changes. NDDs include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
      disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, 
      and motor neuron disease, characterized by cognitive defects and memory 
      impairment, whereas NPDs include depression, seizures, migraine headaches, eating 
      disorders, addictions, palsies, major depressive disorders, anxiety, and 
      schizophrenia, characterized by behavioral changes. Mounting evidence 
      demonstrated that NDDs and NPDs share an overlapping mechanism, which includes 
      post-translational modifications, the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and signaling 
      events. Mounting evidence demonstrated that various drug molecules, namely, 
      natural compounds, repurposed drugs, multitarget directed ligands, and RNAs, have 
      been potentially implemented as therapeutic agents against NDDs and NPDs. Herein, 
      we highlighted the overlapping mechanism, the role of anxiety/stress-releasing 
      factors, cytosol-to-nucleus signaling, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the 
      pathophysiology of NDDs and NPDs. We summarize the therapeutic application of 
      natural compounds, repurposed drugs, and multitarget-directed ligands as 
      therapeutic agents. Lastly, we briefly described the application of RNA 
      interferences as therapeutic agents in the pathogenesis of NDDs and NPDs. 
      Neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases both share a common 
      signaling molecule and molecular phenomenon, namely, pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
      γCaMKII and MAPK/ERK, chemokine receptors, BBB permeability, and the 
      gut-microbiota-brain axis. Studies have demonstrated that any alterations in the 
      signaling mentioned above molecules and molecular phenomena lead to the 
      pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease, 
      Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 
      neuropsychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, 
      anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative 
      disorder characterized by cognitive decline and by the presence of amyloid β 
      plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Despite recent advances in 
      understanding its pathophysiological mechanisms, to date, there are no 
      disease-modifying therapeutic options, to slow or halt the evolution of 
      neurodegenerative processes in AD. Current pharmacological treatments only 
      transiently mitigate the severity of symptoms, with modest or null overall 
      improvement. Emerging evidence supports the concept that AD is affected by the 
      impaired ability of the immune system to restrain the brain's pathology. Deep 
      understanding of the relationship between the nervous and the immune system may 
      provide a novel arena to develop effective and safe drugs for AD treatment. 
      Considering the crucial role of inflammatory/immune pathways in AD, here we 
      discuss the current status of the immuno-oncological, immunomodulatory and 
      anti-TNF-α drugs which are being used in preclinical studies or in ongoing 
      clinical trials by means of the drug-repositioning approach.

AB  - When Alzheimer's disease (AD) disease-modifying therapies will be available, 
      global healthcare systems will be challenged by a large-scale demand for clinical 
      and biological screening. Validation and qualification of globally accessible, 
      minimally-invasive, and time-, cost-saving blood-based biomarkers need to be 
      advanced. Novel pathophysiological mechanisms (and related candidate biomarkers) 
      - including neuroinflammation pathways (TREM2 and YKL-40), axonal degeneration 
      (neurofilament light chain protein), synaptic dysfunction (neurogranin, 
      synaptotagmin, α-synuclein, and SNAP-25) - may be integrated into an expanding 
      pathophysiological and biomarker matrix and, ultimately, integrated into a 
      comprehensive blood-based liquid biopsy, aligned with the evolving 
      ATN + classification system and the precision medicine paradigm. Liquid 
      biopsy-based diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms are increasingly employed in 
      Oncology disease-modifying therapies and medical practice, showing an enormous 
      potential for AD and other brain diseases as well. For AD and other 
      neurodegenerative diseases, newly identified aberrant molecular pathways have 
      been identified as suitable therapeutic targets and are currently investigated by 
      academia/industry-led R&D programs, including the nerve-growth factor pathway in 
      basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, the sigma1 receptor, and the GTPases of the 
      Rho family. Evidence for a clinical long-term effect on cognitive function and 
      brain health span of cholinergic compounds, drug candidates for repositioning 
      programs, and non-pharmacological multidomain interventions (nutrition, cognitive 
      training, and physical activity) is developing as well. Ultimately, novel 
      pharmacological paradigms, such as quantitative systems pharmacology-based 
      integrative/explorative approaches, are gaining momentum to optimize drug 
      discovery and accomplish effective pathway-based strategies for precision 
      medicine. This article is part of the special issue on 'The Quest for 
      Disease-Modifying Therapies for Neurodegenerative Disorders'.

AB  - Apomorphine is a 150-year old nonspecific dopaminergic agonist, currently 
      indicated for treating motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. At the era of 
      drug repurposing, its pleiotropic biological functions suggest other possible 
      uses. To further explore new therapeutic and diagnostic applications, the 
      available literature up to July 2018 was reviewed using the PubMed and Google 
      Scholar databases. As many of the retrieved articles consisted of case reports 
      and preclinical studies, we adopted a descriptive approach, tackling each area of 
      research in turn, to give a broad overview of the potential of apomorphine. 
      Apomorphine may play a role in neurological diseases like restless legs syndrome, 
      Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and 
      disorders of consciousness, but also in sexual disorders, neuroleptic 
      malignant(-like) syndrome and cancer. Further work is needed in both basic and 
      clinical research; current developments in novel delivery strategies and 
      apomorphine derivatives are expected to open the way.

AB  - The risk of neurodegeneration was found to be increased among people with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
      disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and others are 
      considered neurodegenerative diseases and can be characterized by progressive 
      loss of neurons. The deficiency of insulin, impaired signaling, and its 
      resistance lead to alteration in the neuronal functioning of the brain. Insulin 
      degrading enzyme (IDE) plays a significant role in the amyloid β metabolism, 
      aggregation, and deposition of misfolded proteins in the brain's hippocampal and 
      cortical neuronal regions. The insulin signaling via IP3 activation upregulates 
      the IDE and could be a promising approach to regulate neurodegeneration. The 
      repurposing of existing antidiabetic drugs such as Metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, 
      thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1), sodium-glucose co-transport-2 
      (SGCT-2) inhibitors, and insulin could be an alternative and effective strategy 
      to treat neurodegeneration via modulating insulin signaling, insulin resistance, 
      IDE activity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, serum lipid profile 
      and neuroinflammation in the brain. Antidiabetic medications reduce the risk of 
      neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and Aβ deposition by enhancing their 
      clearance rate. The downregulation of IDE alters the degradation of Aβ monomers 
      in the Tg2576 APP mice. Also, the treatment with metformin activated the AMPK 
      pathway and suppressed mTOR and BACE-1 protein expression in the APP/PS1-induced 
      mice model. Thus, the primary intention of this review is to explore the link 
      between T2DM and neurodegenerative disorders, and the possible role of various 
      antidiabetic drugs in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - The novel antibiotic-exploiting strategy in the treatment of Alzheimer's (AD) and 
      Parkinson's (PD) disease has emerged as a potential breakthrough in the field. 
      The research in animal AD/PD models provided evidence on the antiamyloidogenic, 
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiapoptotic activity of tetracyclines, 
      associated with cognitive improvement. The neuroprotective effects of minocycline 
      and doxycycline in animals initiated investigation of their clinical efficacy in 
      AD and PD patients which led to inconclusive results and additionally to 
      insufficient safety data on a long-standing doxycycline and minocycline therapy 
      in these patient populations. The safety issues should be considered in two 
      levels; in AD/PD patients (particularly antibiotic-induced alteration of gut 
      microbiota and its consequences), and as a world-wide threat of development of 
      bacterial resistance to these antibiotics posed by a fact that AD and PD are 
      widespread incurable diseases which require daily administered long-lasting 
      antibiotic therapy. Recently proposed subantimicrobial doxycycline doses should 
      be thoroughly explored for their effectiveness and long-term safety especially in 
      AD/PD populations. Keeping in mind the antibacterial activity-related 
      far-reaching undesirable effects both for the patients and globally, further work 
      on repurposing these drugs for a long-standing therapy of AD/PD should consider 
      the chemically modified tetracycline compounds tailored to lack antimicrobial but 
      retain (or introduce) other activities effective against the AD/PD pathology. 
      This strategy might reduce the risk of long-term therapy-related adverse effects 
      (particularly gut-related ones) and development of bacterial resistance toward 
      the tetracycline antibiotic agents but the therapeutic potential and desirable 
      safety profile of such compounds in AD/PD patients need to be confirmed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) represents a major 
      clinical challenge in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Agitation and aggression are 
      frequently seen during institutionalization and increase patient morbidity and 
      mortality and caregiver burden. Off-label use of atypical antipsychotics for 
      treating agitation in AD showed only modest clinical benefits, with high 
      side-effect burden and risk of mortality. Non-pharmacological treatment 
      approaches have become the preferred first-line option. When such treatment 
      fails, pharmacological options are often used. Therefore, there is an urgent need 
      to identify effective and safe pharmacological treatments for efficiently 
      treating agitation and aggression in AD and dementia. AREAS COVERED: Emerging 
      evidence on the neurobiological substrates of agitation in AD has led to several 
      recent clinical trials of repositioned and novel therapeutics for these NPS in 
      dementia as an alternative to antipsychotics. We operated a comprehensive 
      literature search for published articles evaluating pharmacological interventions 
      for agitation in AD, with a review of recent clinical trials on mibampator, 
      dextromethorphan/quinidine, cannabinoids, and citalopram. EXPERT OPINION: 
      Notwithstanding the renewed interest for the pharmacological treatment of 
      agitation in AD, progresses have been limited. A small number and, sometimes 
      methodologically questionable, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have produced 
      disappointing results. However, recently completed RCTs on novel or repositioned 
      drugs (mibampator, dextromethorphan/quinidine, cannabinoids, and citalopram) 
      showed some promise in treating agitation in AD, but still with safety concerns. 
      Further evidence will come from ongoing Phase II and III trials on promising 
      novel drugs for treating these distressing symptoms in patients with AD and 
      dementia.

TI  - Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease: in silico and in vitro investigation of 
      FDA-approved drugs as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most familiar multifactorial and complex 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by loss of cholinergic neurons in the 
      brain. The various attempts for drug development to treat AD have been hampered 
      by largely unsuccessful clinical trials in the last two decades. Developing a new 
      drug from scratch takes enormous amounts of time, effort and money, mainly due to 
      several barriers in the therapeutic drug development process. Drug repurposing 
      strategy resuscitates this slow drug discovery process by finding new uses and 
      clinical indications for existing drugs. This study is focused on the cholinergic 
      hypothesis, a well-established target of the clinically available drugs in the 
      market for the treatment of AD. The computational virtual screening (VS) led to 
      the identification of thiazolidinedione (TZD, antidiabetic) and aminoquinoline 
      (antimalarial) class of drugs as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. 
      Intriguingly, rosiglitazone (RGZ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were found to be 
      mild-to-moderate inhibitors of hAChE (human acetylcholinesterase) in our enzyme 
      inhibition studies which are complementary to our computational studies. On the 
      basis of our computational and experimental studies, it can be suggested that the 
      beneficial effect of RGZ and HCQ in AD patients reported in the literature may 
      partly be due to their AChE inhibitory property. The VS also led to the 
      identification of antifungal drugs miconazole and oxiconazole as potential AChE 
      inhibitors. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the potential hits 
      belonging to TZD, aminoquinoline and azoles class were also carried out. The MD 
      simulations studies revealed detailed computational insights related to molecular 
      interactions and protein-ligand stability for selected hits.

PG  - 226-234

AB  - Treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major challenge at the moment with no new 
      drugs available to cure this devastating neurodegenerative disorder. In this 
      regard, drug repurposing, which aims to determine novel therapeutic usage for 
      drugs already approved by the regulatory agencies, is a pragmatic approach to 
      discover novel treatment strategies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      (SSRIs) are a known class of United States Food and Drug Administration approved 
      drugs used in the treatment of depression. We investigated the ability of SSRIs 
      fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and escitalopram on Aβ42 
      aggregation and fibrillogenesis. Remarkably, the aggregation kinetic experiments 
      carried out demonstrate the anti-Aβ42 aggregation activity of SSRIs fluoxetine, 
      paroxetine, and sertraline at all the tested concentrations (1, 10, 50, and 100 
      μM). Both fluoxetine and paroxetine were identified as the most promising SSRIs, 
      showing 74.8 and 76% inhibition of Aβ42 aggregation at 100 μM. The transmission 
      electron microscopy experiments and dot-blot study also demonstrate the ability 
      of fluoxetine and paroxetine to prevent Aβ42 aggregation and fibrillogenesis, 
      providing further evidence. Investigating the binding interactions of fluoxetine 
      and paroxetine in the Aβ42 oligomer and fibril models derived from the 
      solid-state NMR structure suggests that these SSRIs interact at a region close to 
      the N-terminal (Lys16-Glu22) in the S-shaped cross-β-strand assembly and reduce 
      Aβ42 fibrillogenesis. On the basis of this study, a pharmacophore model is 
      proposed which shows that the minimum structural requirements to design novel 
      Aβ42 aggregation inhibitors include the presence of one ionizable group, one 
      hydrophobic group, two aromatic rings, and two hydrogen bond donor groups. These 
      studies demonstrate that SSRIs have the potential to prevent Aβ42 aggregation by 
      direct binding and could be beneficial to AD patients on SSRIs.

TI  - Exploring the Multifaceted Potential of Sildenafil in Medicine.
LID - 10.3390/medicina59122190 [doi]
LID - 2190
AB  - Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) is pivotal in cellular signalling, regulating 
      cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels crucial for smooth muscle relaxation 
      and vasodilation. By targeting cGMP for degradation, PDE5 inhibits sustained 
      vasodilation. PDE5 operates in diverse anatomical regions, with its upregulation 
      linked to various pathologies, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Sildenafil, a selective PDE5 inhibitor, is prescribed for erectile dysfunction 
      and pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, considering the extensive roles of 
      PDE5, sildenafil might be useful in other pathologies. This review aims to 
      comprehensively explore sildenafil's therapeutic potential across medicine, 
      addressing a gap in the current literature. Recognising sildenafil's broader 
      potential may unveil new treatment avenues, optimising existing approaches and 
      broadening its clinical application.

TI  - Repurposing of Copper(II)-chelating Drugs for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative 
      Diseases.
PG  - 525-539
LID - 10.2174/0929867324666170518094404 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is mounting urgency to find new drugs for the treatment of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. A large number of reviews have exhaustively 
      described either the molecular or clinical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases 
      such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD). Conversely, reports outlining how 
      known drugs in use for other diseases can also be effective as therapeutic agents 
      in neurodegenerative diseases are less reported. This review focuses on the 
      current uses of some copper(II) chelating molecules as potential drug candidates 
      in neurodegeneration. METHODS: Starting from the well-known harmful relationships 
      existing between the dyshomeostasis and mis-management of metals and AD onset, we 
      surveyed the experimental work reported in the literature, which deals with the 
      repositioning of metal-chelating drugs in the field of neurodegenerative 
      diseases. The reviewed papers were retrieved from common literature and their 
      selection was limited to those describing the biomolecular aspects associated 
      with neuroprotection. In particular, we emphasized the copper(II) coordination 
      abilities of the selected drugs. RESULTS: Copper, together with zinc and iron, 
      are known to play a key role in regulating neuronal functions. Changes in copper 
      homeostasis are crucial for several neurodegenerative disorders. The studies 
      included in this review may provide an overview on the current strategies aimed 
      at repurposing copper (II) chelating drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. Starting from the exemplary case of clioquinol repurposing, we discuss 
      the challenge and the opportunities that repurposing of other metal-chelating 
      drugs may provide (e.g. PBT-2, metformin and cyclodipeptides) in the treatment of 
      neurodegenerative disease. CONCLUSIONS: In order to improve the success rate of 
      drug repositioning, comprehensive studies on the molecular mechanism and 
      therapeutic efficacy are still required. The present review upholds that drug 
      repurposing makes significant advantages over drug discovery since repositioned 
      drugs had already passed the safety and toxicity tests. Promising drug candidates 
      in neurodegenerative diseases may be represented by copper chelating classes of 
      drugs, provided that sufficient details on their mechanism of action are 
      available to encourage further investigations and clinical trials.

TI  - A phase II study repurposing atomoxetine for neuroprotection in mild cognitive 
      impairment.
PG  - 1924-1938
LID - 10.1093/brain/awab452 [doi]
AB  - The locus coeruleus is the initial site of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, 
      with hyperphosphorylated Tau appearing in early adulthood followed by 
      neurodegeneration in dementia. Locus coeruleus dysfunction contributes to 
      Alzheimer's pathobiology in experimental models, which can be rescued by 
      increasing norepinephrine transmission. To test norepinephrine augmentation as a 
      potential disease-modifying therapy, we performed a biomarker-driven phase II 
      trial of atomoxetine, a clinically-approved norepinephrine transporter inhibitor, 
      in subjects with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. The design 
      was a single-centre, 12-month double-blind crossover trial. Thirty-nine 
      participants with mild cognitive impairment and biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's 
      disease were randomized to atomoxetine or placebo treatment. Assessments were 
      collected at baseline, 6- (crossover) and 12-months (completer). Target 
      engagement was assessed by CSF and plasma measures of norepinephrine and 
      metabolites. Prespecified primary outcomes were CSF levels of IL1α and TECK. 
      Secondary/exploratory outcomes included clinical measures, CSF analyses of 
      amyloid-β42, Tau, and pTau181, mass spectrometry proteomics and immune-based 
      targeted inflammation-related cytokines, as well as brain imaging with MRI and 
      fluorodeoxyglucose-PET. Baseline demographic and clinical measures were similar 
      across trial arms. Dropout rates were 5.1% for atomoxetine and 2.7% for placebo, 
      with no significant differences in adverse events. Atomoxetine robustly increased 
      plasma and CSF norepinephrine levels. IL-1α and TECK were not measurable in most 
      samples. There were no significant treatment effects on cognition and clinical 
      outcomes, as expected given the short trial duration. Atomoxetine was associated 
      with a significant reduction in CSF Tau and pTau181 compared to placebo, but not 
      associated with change in amyloid-β42. Atomoxetine treatment also significantly 
      altered CSF abundances of protein panels linked to brain pathophysiologies, 
      including synaptic, metabolism and glial immunity, as well as 
      inflammation-related CDCP1, CD244, TWEAK and osteoprotegerin proteins. Treatment 
      was also associated with significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor and reduced triglycerides in plasma. Resting state functional MRI showed 
      significantly increased inter-network connectivity due to atomoxetine between the 
      insula and the hippocampus. Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET showed atomoxetine-associated 
      increased uptake in hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, middle temporal pole, 
      inferior temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus, with carry-over effects 6 months 
      after treatment. In summary, atomoxetine treatment was safe, well tolerated and 
      achieved target engagement in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Atomoxetine 
      significantly reduced CSF Tau and pTau, normalized CSF protein biomarker panels 
      linked to synaptic function, brain metabolism and glial immunity, and increased 
      brain activity and metabolism in key temporal lobe circuits. Further study of 
      atomoxetine is warranted for repurposing the drug to slow Alzheimer's disease 
      progression.

TI  - Drug repositioning in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 184-8
AB  - Drug repositioning offers an innovative approach to drug discovery with great 
      potential in the field of Alzheimer's Disease and dementia therapeutics. 
      Investigation of licensed compounds enables processing through the drug discovery 
      pipeline in a rapid and cost-effective manner. A growing body of evidence 
      supports the translation of priority compounds to be taken forward to clinical 
      trials, based on established and proposed mechanisms of action. A number of drugs 
      have already entered clinical trial following repositioning, and novel 
      technologies have been created to enable high-throughput screening. This review 
      discusses the novel approaches that build on transcriptional signature profiling 
      to support repositioning in AD, and the novel candidate drugs that are emerging 
      from this exciting new technique.

AB  - To identify the molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic agents of late-onset 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), we performed integrative network analysis using 
      multiple transcriptomic profiles of human brains. With the hypothesis that AD 
      pathology involves the whole cerebrum, we first identified co-expressed modules 
      across multiple cerebral regions of the aging human brain. Among them, two 
      modules (M3 and M8) consisting of 1,429 protein-coding genes were significantly 
      enriched with AD-correlated genes. Differential expression analysis of 
      microarray, bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed the dysregulation of M3 
      and M8 across different cerebral regions in both normal aging and AD. The 
      cell-type enrichment analysis and differential expression analysis at the 
      single-cell resolution indicated the extensive neuronal vulnerability in AD 
      pathogenesis. Transcriptomic-based drug screening from Connectivity Map proposed 
      Gly-His-Lys acetate salt (GHK) as a potential drug candidate that could probably 
      restore the dysregulated genes of the M3 and M8 network. Pretreatment with GHK 
      showed a neuroprotective effect against amyloid-beta-induced injury in 
      differentiated human neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, our findings 
      uncover a dysregulated network disrupted across multiple cerebral regions in AD 
      and propose pretreatment with GHK as a novel neuroprotective strategy against AD.

TI  - Drug Repurposing to Inhibit Histamine N-Methyl Transferase.
LID - 10.3390/molecules28020576 [doi]
LID - 576
AB  - Lower activity of the histaminergic system is associated with neurological 
      disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the enhancement of 
      histaminergic neurotransmission by inhibition of histamine N-methyl transferase 
      (HNMT), which degrades histamine, appears as an important approach. For this 
      purpose, rigid and flexible molecular docking studies of 185 FDA-approved drugs 
      with the HNMT enzyme were carried out to select two compounds to perform 
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate the binding free energies and 
      stability of the enzyme-drug complexes. Finally, an HNMT inhibition assay was 
      performed to corroborate their effect towards HNMT. Molecular docking studies 
      with HNMT allowed the selection of dihydroergotamine and vilazodone since these 
      molecules showed the lowest Gibbs free energy values. Analysis of the binding 
      mode of vilazodone showed interactions with the binding pocket of HNMT with 
      Glu28, Gln143, and Asn283. In contrast, dihydroergotamine binds to the HNMT 
      active site in a different location, apparently because it is overall the more 
      rigid ligand compared to flexible vilazodone. HNMT inhibitory activity for 
      dihydroergotamine and vilazodone was corroborated (IC(50) = 72.89 μM and 45.01 
      μM, respectively) by in vitro assays. Drug repurposing of HNMT was achieved by 
      employing computational studies.

AB  - Background: Traditional therapeutics targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related 
      subpathologies have so far proved ineffective. Drug repurposing, a more effective 
      strategy that aims to find new indications for existing drugs against other 
      diseases, offers benefits in AD drug development. In this study, we aim to 
      identify potential anti-AD agents through enrichment analysis of drug-induced 
      transcriptional profiles of pathways based on AD-associated risk genes identified 
      from genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) and single-cell transcriptomic 
      studies. Methods: We systematically constructed four gene lists (972 risk genes) 
      from GWAS and single-cell transcriptomic studies and performed functional and 
      genes overlap analyses in Enrichr tool. We then used a comprehensive drug 
      repurposing tool Gene2Drug by combining drug-induced transcriptional responses 
      with the associated pathways to compute candidate drugs from each gene list. 
      Prioritized potential candidates (eight drugs) were further assessed with 
      literature review. Results: The genomic-based gene lists contain late-onset AD 
      associated genes (BIN1, ABCA7, APOE, CLU, and PICALM) and clinical AD drug 
      targets (TREM2, CD33, CHRNA2, PRSS8, ACE, TKT, APP, and GABRA1). Our analysis 
      identified eight AD candidate drugs (ellipticine, alsterpaullone, tomelukast, 
      ginkgolide A, chrysin, ouabain, sulindac sulfide and lorglumide), four of which 
      (alsterpaullone, ginkgolide A, chrysin and ouabain) have shown repurposing 
      potential for AD validated by their preclinical evidence and moderate toxicity 
      profiles from literature. These support the value of pathway-based prioritization 
      based on the disease risk genes from GWAS and scRNA-seq data analysis. 
      Conclusion: Our analysis strategy identified some potential drug candidates for 
      AD. Although the drugs still need further experimental validation, the approach 
      may be applied to repurpose drugs for other neurological disorders using their 
      genomic information identified from large-scale genomic studies.

AB  - Drug repositioning and repurposing can enhance traditional drug development 
      efforts and could accelerate the identification of new treatments for individuals 
      with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia and mild cognitive impairment. 
      Transcriptional profiling offers a new and highly efficient approach to the 
      identification of novel candidates for repositioning and repurposing. In the 
      future, novel AD transcriptional signatures from cells isolated at early stages 
      of disease, or from human neurons or microglia that carry mutations that increase 
      the risk of AD, might be used as probes to identify additional candidate drugs. 
      Phase II trials assessing repurposed agents must consider the best target 
      population for a specific candidate therapy as well as the mechanism of action of 
      the treatment. In this Review, we highlight promising compounds to prioritize for 
      clinical trials in individuals with AD, and discuss the value of Delphi consensus 
      methodology and evidence-based reviews to inform this prioritization process. We 
      also describe emerging work, focusing on the potential value of transcript 
      signatures as a cost-effective approach to the identification of novel candidates 
      for repositioning.

AB  - The underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex and includes, 
      besides amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque depositions and neurofibrillary tangles, brain 
      atrophy and neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, impaired neurogenesis, vascular 
      and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruptions, neurotransmitter disbalances, and 
      others. Here, we hypothesize that such complex pathologies can only be targeted 
      efficiently through pleiotropic approaches. One interesting drug target is the 
      leukotriene pathway, which mediates various aspects of AD pathology. Approaching 
      this pathway at different levels with genetic and pharmacological tools 
      demonstrated beneficial outcomes in several in vivo studies using different mouse 
      models of AD. Here, we review the current literature on the leukotriene signaling 
      pathway as a target for drug development in AD.

TI  - PDE3 Inhibitors Repurposed as Treatments for Age-Related Cognitive Impairment.
PG  - 4306-4316

AB  - As the population of older individuals grows worldwide, researchers have 
      increasingly focused their attention on identifying key molecular targets of 
      age-related cognitive impairments, with the aim of developing possible 
      therapeutic interventions. Two such molecules are the intracellular cyclic 
      nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP. These second messengers mediate fundamental aspects 
      of brain function relevant to memory, learning, and cognitive function. 
      Consequently, phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which hydrolyze cAMP and cGMP, are 
      promising targets for the development of cognition-enhancing drugs. Inhibitors 
      that target PDEs work by elevating intracellular cAMP. In this review, we provide 
      an overview of different PDE inhibitors, and then we focus on pharmacological and 
      physiological effects of PDE3 inhibitors in the CNS and peripheral tissues. 
      Finally, we discuss findings from experimental and preliminary clinical studies 
      and the potential beneficial effects of the PDE3 inhibitor cilostazol on 
      age-related cognitive impairments. In the innovation pipeline of pharmaceutical 
      development, the antiplatelet agent cilostazol has come into the spotlight as a 
      novel treatment for mild cognitive impairment. Overall, the repurposing of 
      cilostazol may represent a potentially promising way to treat mild cognitive 
      impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. In this review, we 
      present a brief summary of cAMP signaling and different PDE inhibitors, followed 
      by a discussion of the pharmacological and physiological role of PDE3 inhibitors. 
      In this context, we discuss the repurposing of a PDE3 inhibitor, cilostazol, as a 
      potential treatment for age-related cognitive impairment based on recent 
      research.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), an extremely progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorder is an amalgamation of numerous intricate pathological 
      networks. This century old disease is still an unmet medical condition owing to 
      the modest efficacy of existing therapeutic agents in antagonizing the 
      multi-targeted pathological pathways underlying AD. Given the paucity in AD 
      specific drugs, fabricating comprehensive research strategies to envision disease 
      specific targets to channelize and expedite drug discovery are mandated. However, 
      the dwindling approval rates and stringent regulatory constraints concerning the 
      approval of a new chemical entity is daunting the pharmaceutical industries from 
      effectuating de novo research. To bridge the existing gaps in AD drug research, a 
      promising contemporary way out could be drug repurposing. This drug repurposing 
      investigation is intended to envisage AD specific targets and create drug 
      libraries pertinent to the shortlisted targets via a series of avant-garde 
      bioinformatics and computational strategies. METHODS: Transcriptomic analysis of 
      three AD specific datasets viz., GSE122063, GSE15222 and GSE5281 revealed 
      significant Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) and subsequent Protein-Protein 
      Interactions (PPI) network analysis captured crucial AD targets. Later, homology 
      model was constructed through I-TASSER for a shortlisted target protein which 
      lacked X-ray crystallographic structure and the built protein model was validated 
      by molecular dynamic simulations. Further, drug library was created for the 
      shortlisted target based on structural and side effect similarity with respective 
      standard drugs. Finally, molecular docking, binding energy calculations and 
      molecular dynamics studies were carried out to unravel the interactions exhibited 
      by drugs from the created library with amino acids in active binding pocket of 
      RGS4. RESULTS: SST and RGS4 were shortlisted as potentially significant AD 
      specific targets, however, the less explored target RGS4 was considered for 
      further sequential analysis. Homology model constructed for RGS4 displayed best 
      quality when validated through Ramachandran plot and ERRAT plot. Subsequent 
      docking and molecular dynamics studies showcased substantial affinity 
      demonstrated by three drugs viz., Ziprasidone, Melfoquine and Metaxalone from the 
      created drug libraries, towards RGS4. CONCLUSION: This virtual analysis 
      forecasted the repurposable potential of Ziprasidone, Melfoquine and Metaxalone 
      against AD based on their affinity towards RGS4, a key AD-specific target.

TI  - Investigating Neuroprotective Potential of Berberine, Levetiracetam and their 
      Combination in the Management of Alzheimer's Disease Utilizing Drug Repurposing 
      Strategy.
PG  - 182-190
LID - 10.2174/2772432816666210910104306 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of the present work was to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of 
      berberine, levetiracetam and their combination in lead acetate-induced 
      neurotoxicity by applying a drug repositioning approach. BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairment of 
      memory, disturbances in reasoning, planning, language and perception. Currently, 
      there are only four drugs approved by US-FDA for AD; therefore, there is an 
      extensive need for new drug development. The drug repositioning approach refers 
      to the development of new uses for existing or abandoned pharmaceuticals. Several 
      studies support the neuroprotective abilities of anti-oxidants resulting in 
      neuronal protection against neurotoxins, suppression of oxidative stress and 
      promotion of memory, learning and cognitive functions. Many natural polyphenols 
      are being investigated as a potential therapeutic option for AD. Levetiracetam 
      (LEV), a second-generation antiepileptic drug, is a new molecule that is clearly 
      differentiated from conventional antiepileptic drugs by its pharmacologic 
      properties. LEV also has been previously demonstrated to protect against 
      oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity in several models of seizures. Berberine 
      (BBR) is an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant phytoconstituent. OBJECTIVE: To 
      study the therapeutic effect of berberine, levetiracetam and their physical 
      mixture in lead acetate-induced neurotoxicity in Swiss albino mice for probable 
      application in the management of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Neurotoxicity was 
      induced in Swiss albino mice by lead acetate. Behavioural parameters, such as 
      transfer latency time and percentage alternation, were studied using Morris water 
      maze (MWM), Elevated plus-maze test (EPM) and Y-maze for the assessment of 
      improvement in learning and memory. Concentrations of acetylcholinesterase, MDA 
      and GSH in the brain were also estimated. Brain samples were subjected to 
      histopathological studies. RESULTS: Results revealed that the combination of BBR 
      and LEV exhibited a significant neuroprotective effect by decreasing escape 
      latency time and increasing time spent in the target quadrant in MWM. The 
      combination also decreases transfer latency time in EPM and acetylcholinesterase 
      levels in the brain as compared to standard donepezil. Reduced neuronal damage 
      was also confirmed by the histopathological report. CONCLUSION: Leveteracitam, 
      berberin and their combination resulted in the significant conservation of 
      various behavioural, biochemical, enzymatic and anti-oxidant parameters that were 
      evaluated. The neuroprotective effect of plain leveteracitam and berberin was 
      significantly better than their combination. The anticipated synergism or 
      additive effect was not observed with the combination of leveteracitam and 
      berberin in lead acetate-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - The spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases known today is quite extensive. The 
      complexities of their research and treatment lie not only in their diversity. 
      Even many years of struggle and narrowly focused research on common pathologies 
      such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other brain diseases have not brought cures 
      for these illnesses. What can be said about orphan diseases? In particular, 
      Huntington's disease (HD), despite affecting a smaller part of the human 
      population, still attracts many researchers. This disorder is known to result 
      from a mutation in the HTT gene, but having this information still does not 
      simplify the task of drug development and studying the mechanisms of disease 
      progression. Nonetheless, the data accumulated over the years and their analysis 
      provide a good basis for further research. Here, we review studies devoted to 
      understanding the mechanisms of HD. We analyze genes and molecular pathways 
      involved in HD pathogenesis to describe the action of repurposed drugs and try to 
      find new therapeutic targets.

TI  - Baricitinib and tofacitinib off-target profile, with a focus on Alzheimer's 
      disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors were recently identified as promising 
      drug candidates for repurposing in Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to their capacity 
      to suppress inflammation via modulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Besides 
      interaction with primary therapeutic targets, JAK inhibitor drugs frequently 
      interact with unintended, often unknown, biological off-targets, leading to 
      associated effects. Nevertheless, the relevance of JAK inhibitors' off-target 
      interactions in the context of AD remains unclear. METHODS: Putative off-targets 
      of baricitinib and tofacitinib were predicted using a machine learning (ML) 
      approach. After screening scientific literature, off-targets were filtered based 
      on their relevance to AD. Targets that had not been previously identified as 
      off-targets of baricitinib or tofacitinib were subsequently tested using 
      biochemical or cell-based assays. From those, active concentrations were compared 
      to bioavailable concentrations in the brain predicted by physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. RESULTS: With the aid of ML and in vitro 
      activity assays, we identified two enzymes previously unknown to be inhibited by 
      baricitinib, namely casein kinase 2 subunit alpha 2 (CK2-α2) and dual leucine 
      zipper kinase (MAP3K12), both with binding constant (K (d)) values of 5.8 μM. 
      Predicted maximum concentrations of baricitinib in brain tissue using PBPK 
      modeling range from 1.3 to 23 nM, which is two to three orders of magnitude below 
      the corresponding binding constant. CONCLUSION: In this study, we extended the 
      list of baricitinib off-targets that are potentially relevant for AD progression 
      and predicted drug distribution in the brain. The results suggest a low 
      likelihood of successful repurposing in AD due to low brain permeability, even at 
      the maximum recommended daily dose. While additional research is needed to 
      evaluate the potential impact of the off-target interaction on AD, the combined 
      approach of ML-based target prediction, in vitro confirmation, and PBPK modeling 
      may help prioritize drugs with a high likelihood of being effectively repurposed 
      for AD. HIGHLIGHTS: This study explored JAK inhibitors' off-targets in AD using a 
      multidisciplinary approach.We combined machine learning, in vitro tests, and PBPK 
      modelling to predict and validate new off-target interactions of tofacitinib and 
      baricitinib in AD.Previously unknown inhibition of two enzymes (CK2-a2 and 
      MAP3K12) by baricitinib were confirmed using in vitro experiments.Our PBPK model 
      indicates that baricitinib low brain permeability limits AD repurposing.The 
      proposed multidisciplinary approach optimizes drug repurposing efforts in AD 
      research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is one of the key factors leading to neuron death 
      and synapse dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to 
      have an association with microglia activation and trigger neuroinflammation in 
      AD. However, inflammation response in brain disorders is heterogenous, and thus, 
      it is necessary to unveil the specific gene module of neuroinflammation caused by 
      Aβ in AD, which might provide novel biomarkers for AD diagnosis and help 
      understand the mechanism of the disease. METHODS: Transcriptomic datasets of 
      brain region tissues from AD patients and the corresponding normal tissues were 
      first used to identify gene modules through the weighted gene co-expression 
      network analysis (WGCNA) method. Then, key modules highly associated with Aβ 
      accumulation and neuroinflammatory response were pinpointed by combining module 
      expression score and functional information. Meanwhile, the relationship of the 
      Aβ-associated module to the neuron and microglia was explored based on snRNA-seq 
      data. Afterward, transcription factor (TF) enrichment and the SCENIC analysis 
      were performed on the Aβ-associated module to discover the related upstream 
      regulators, and then a PPI network proximity method was employed to repurpose the 
      potential approved drugs for AD. RESULTS: A total of 16 co-expression modules 
      were primarily obtained by the WGCNA method. Among them, the green module was 
      significantly correlated with Aβ accumulation, and its function was mainly 
      involved in neuroinflammation response and neuron death. Thus, the module was 
      termed the amyloid-β induced neuroinflammation module (AIM). Moreover, the module 
      was negatively correlated with neuron percentage and showed a close association 
      with inflammatory microglia. Finally, based on the module, several important TFs 
      were recognized as potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD, and then 20 possible 
      drugs including ibrutinib and ponatinib were picked out for the disease. 
      CONCLUSION: In this study, a specific gene module, termed AIM, was identified as 
      a key sub-network of Aβ accumulation and neuroinflammation in AD. Moreover, the 
      module was verified as having an association with neuron degeneration and 
      inflammatory microglia transformation. Moreover, some promising TFs and potential 
      repurposing drugs were presented for AD based on the module. The findings of the 
      study shed new light on the mechanistic investigation of AD and might make 
      benefits the treatment of the disease.

AB  - The geroscience hypothesis proposes biological hallmarks of ageing are 
      modifiable. Increasing evidence supports targeting these hallmarks with 
      therapeutics could prevent and ameliorate age-related conditions - collectively 
      termed "geroprotector drugs". Cellular senescence is a hallmark with considerable 
      potential to be modified with geroprotector drugs. Senotherapeutics are drugs 
      that target cellular senescence for therapeutic benefit. Repurposing commonly 
      used medications with secondary geroprotector properties is a strategy of 
      interest to promote incorporation of geroprotector drugs into clinical practice. 
      One candidate is the cardiac glycoside digoxin. Evidence in mouse models of 
      pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis and atherosclerosis support 
      digoxin as a senotherapeutic agent. Proposed senolytic mechanisms are 
      upregulation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways and promoting intracellular 
      acidification. Digoxin also appears to have a senomorphic mechanism - altering 
      the T cell pool to ameliorate pro-inflammatory SASP. Despite being widely 
      prescribed to treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure, often in multimorbid 
      older adults, it is not known whether digoxin exerts senotherapeutic effects in 
      humans. Further cellular and animal studies, and ultimately clinical trials with 
      participation of pre-frail older adults, are required to identify whether digoxin 
      has senotherapeutic effect at low dose. This paper reviews the biological 
      mechanisms identified in preliminary cellular and animal studies that support 
      repurposing digoxin as a geroprotector in patients with frailty and 
      multimorbidity.

AB  - The emergence of large-scale phenotypic, genetic, and other multi-model 
      biochemical data has offered unprecedented opportunities for drug discovery 
      including drug repurposing. Various knowledge graph-based methods have been 
      developed to integrate and analyze complex and heterogeneous data sources to find 
      new therapeutic applications for existing drugs. However, existing methods have 
      limitations in modeling and capturing context-sensitive inter-relationships among 
      tens of thousands of biomedical entities. In this paper, we developed KG-Predict: 
      a knowledge graph computational framework for drug repurposing. We first 
      integrated multiple types of entities and relations from various genotypic and 
      phenotypic databases to construct a knowledge graph termed GP-KG. GP-KG was 
      composed of 1,246,726 associations between 61,146 entities. KG-Predict then 
      aggregated the heterogeneous topological and semantic information from GP-KG to 
      learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations, and further 
      utilized these representations to infer new drug-disease interactions. In 
      cross-validation experiments, KG-Predict achieved high performances [AUROC (the 
      area under receiver operating characteristic) = 0.981, AUPR (the area under 
      precision-recall) = 0.409 and MRR (the mean reciprocal rank) = 0.261], 
      outperforming other state-of-art graph embedding methods. We applied KG-Predict 
      in identifying novel repositioned candidate drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      and showed that KG-Predict prioritized both FDA-approved and active clinical 
      trial anti-AD drugs among the top (AUROC = 0.868 and AUPR = 0.364).

AB  - Drug repurposing can accelerate drug development while reducing the cost and risk 
      of toxicity typically associated with de novo drug design. Several disorders 
      lacking pharmacological solutions and exhibiting poor results in clinical trials 
      - such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) - could benefit from a cost-effective approach 
      to finding new therapeutics. We previously developed a neural network model, 
      Z-LaP Tracker, capable of quantifying behaviors in zebrafish larvae relevant to 
      cognitive function, including activity, reactivity, swimming patterns, and 
      optomotor response in the presence of visual and acoustic stimuli. Using this 
      model, we performed a high-throughput screening of FDA-approved drugs to identify 
      compounds that affect zebrafish larval behavior in a manner consistent with the 
      distinct behavior induced by calcineurin inhibitors. Cyclosporine (CsA) and other 
      calcineurin inhibitors have garnered interest for their potential role in the 
      prevention of AD. We generated behavioral profiles suitable for cluster analysis, 
      through which we identified 64 candidate therapeutics for neurodegenerative 
      disorders.

TI  - Tetrahydrobiopterin Improves Recognition Memory in the Triple-Transgenic Mouse 
      Model of Alzheimer's Disease, Without Altering Amyloid-β and Tau Pathologies.
PG  - 709-727
LID - 10.3233/JAD-200637 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease, implying that 
      multi-target treatments may be necessary to effectively cure AD. 
      Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an enzymatic cofactor required for the synthesis of 
      monoamines and nitric oxide that also exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
      effects. Despite its crucial role in the CNS, the potential of BH4 as a treatment 
      in AD has never been scrutinized. OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated whether BH4 
      peripheral administration improves cognitive symptoms and AD neuropathology in 
      the triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD), a model of age-related tau and 
      amyloid-β (Aβ) neuropathologies associated with behavior impairment. METHODS: 
      Non-transgenic (NonTg) and 3xTg-AD mice were subjected to a control diet (5% fat 
      - CD) or to a high-fat diet (35% fat - HFD) from 6 to 13 months to exacerbate 
      metabolic disorders. Then, mice received either BH4 (15 mg/kg/day, i.p.) or 
      vehicle for ten consecutive days. RESULTS: This sub-chronic administration of BH4 
      rescued memory impairment in 13-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, as determined using the 
      novel object recognition test. Moreover, the HFD-induced glucose intolerance was 
      completely reversed by the BH4 treatment in 3xTg-AD mice. However, the HFD or BH4 
      treatment had no significant impact on Aβ and tau neuropathologies. CONCLUSION: 
      Overall, our data suggest a potential benefit from BH4 administration against AD 
      cognitive and metabolic deficits accentuated by HFD consumption in 3xTg-AD mice, 
      without altering classical neuropathology. Therefore, BH4 should be considered as 
      a candidate for drug repurposing, at least in subtypes of cognitively impaired 
      patients experiencing metabolic disorders.

TI  - Repositioning of clinically approved drug Bazi Bushen capsule for treatment of 
      Aizheimer's disease using network pharmacology approach and in vitro experimental 
      validation.

AB  - AIMS: To explore the new indications and key mechanism of Bazi Bushen capsule 
      (BZBS) by network pharmacology and in vitro experiment. METHODS: The ingredients 
      library of BZBS was constructed by retrieving multiple TCM databases. The 
      potential target profiles of the components were predicted by target prediction 
      algorithms based on different principles, and validated by using known activity 
      data. The target spectrum of BZBS with high reliability was screened by 
      considering the source of the targets and the node degree in compound-target 
      (C-T) network. Subsequently, new indications for BZBS were predicted by disease 
      ontology (DO) enrichment analysis and initially validated by GO and KEGG pathway 
      enrichment analysis. Furthermore, the target sets of BZBS acting on AD signaling 
      pathway were identified by intersection analysis. Based on STRING database, the 
      PPI network of target was constructed and their node degree was calculated. Two 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) cell models, BV-2 and SH-SY5Y, were used to 
      preliminarily verify the anti-AD efficacy and mechanism of BZBS in vitro. 
      RESULTS: In total, 1499 non-repeated ingredients were obtained from 16 herbs in 
      BZBS formula, and 1320 BZBS targets with high confidence were predicted. Disease 
      enrichment results strongly suggested that BZBS formula has the potential to be 
      used in the treatment of AD. GO and KEGG enrichment results provide a preliminary 
      verification of this point. Among them, 113 functional targets of BZBS belong to 
      AD pathway. A PPI network containing 113 functional targets and 1051 edges for 
      the treatment of AD was constructed. In vitro experiments showed that BZBS could 
      significantly reduce the release of TNF-α and IL-6 and the expression of COX-2 
      and PSEN1 in Aβ(25-35)-induced BV-2 cells, which may be related to the regulation 
      of ERK(1/2)/NF-κB signaling pathway. BZBS reduced the apoptosis rate of Aβ(25-35) 
      induced SH-SY5Y cells, significantly increased mitochondrial membrane potential, 
      reduced the expression of Caspase3 active fragment and PSEN1, and increased the 
      expression of IDE. This may be related to the regulation of GSK-3β/β-catenin 
      signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: BZBS formula has a potential use in the treatment 
      of AD, which is achieved through regulation of ERK(1/2), NF-κB signaling 
      pathways, and GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, the network 
      pharmacology technology is a feasible drug repurposing strategy to reposition new 
      clinical use of approved TCM and explore the mechanism of action. The study lays 
      a foundation for the subsequent in-depth study of BZBS in the treatment of AD and 
      provides a basis for its application in the clinical treatment of AD.

AB  - Acetylcholinesterase/Butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors are considered an effective 
      method for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this current work, we have 
      computationally analyzed 11 new small molecule drugs used in various neurological 
      diseases and Donepezil, a known inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, as a positive 
      control. We investigated these drugs for possible fundamental interactions with 
      acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase as both are critical in the 
      pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. We have selected FDA approved compounds 
      for repurposing as possible inhibitors of these enzymes and novel therapeutic 
      option for Alzheimer's disease. We selected the top two molecules for each 
      protein for their binding energies, interactions, and Donepezil, the most 
      commonly used drug for AD treatment. Molecular simulation and dynamics studies of 
      the top 2 drugs in each case and free energy analysis helped us reach further 
      conclusions about the best possible drugs for repurposing. Brexipirazole and 
      Deutetrabenazine produce encouraging results as butyrylcholinesterase and 
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, respectively.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease 
      characterised by the accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau in the brain, leading 
      to the progressive loss of memory and cognition. The causes of its pathogenesis 
      are still not fully understood, but some risk factors, such as age, genetics, and 
      hormones, may play a crucial role. Studies show that postmenopausal women have a 
      higher risk of developing AD, possibly due to the decrease in hormone levels, 
      especially oestrogen, which may be directly related to a reduction in the 
      activity of oestrogen receptors, especially beta (ERβ), which favours a more 
      hostile cellular environment, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, mainly 
      affecting key processes related to transport, metabolism, and oxidative 
      phosphorylation. Given the influence of hormones on biological processes at the 
      mitochondrial level, hormone therapies are of clinical interest to reduce the 
      risk or delay the onset of symptoms associated with AD. One drug with such 
      potential is tibolone, which is used in clinics to treat menopause-related 
      symptoms. It can reduce amyloid burden and have benefits on mitochondrial 
      integrity and dynamics. Many of its protective effects are mediated through 
      steroid receptors and may also be related to neuroglobin, whose elevated levels 
      have been shown to protect against neurological diseases. Its importance has 
      increased exponentially due to its implication in the pathogenesis of AD. In this 
      review, we discuss recent advances in tibolone, focusing on its 
      mitochondrial-protective effects, and highlight how valuable this compound could 
      be as a therapeutic alternative to mitigate the molecular pathways characteristic 
      of AD.

TI  - Repurposing Metformin for the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation: Current Insights.
PG  - 255-288
LID - 10.2147/VHRM.S391808 [doi]
AB  - Metformin is an orally effective anti-hyperglycemic drug that despite being 
      introduced over 60 years ago is still utilized by an estimated 120 to 150 million 
      people worldwide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Metformin is used 
      off-label for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and for 
      pre-diabetes and weight loss. Metformin is a safe, inexpensive drug with side 
      effects mostly limited to gastrointestinal issues. Prospective clinical data from 
      the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), completed in 1998, 
      demonstrated that metformin not only has excellent therapeutic efficacy as an 
      anti-diabetes drug but also that good glycemic control reduced the risk of micro- 
      and macro-vascular complications, especially in obese patients and thereby 
      reduced the risk of diabetes-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). Based on a 
      long history of clinical use and an excellent safety record metformin has been 
      investigated to be repurposed for numerous other diseases including as an 
      anti-aging agent, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, cancer, COVID-19 and 
      also atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is the most frequently diagnosed cardiac 
      arrythmia and its prevalence is increasing globally as the population ages. The 
      argument for repurposing metformin for AF is based on a combination of 
      retrospective clinical data and in vivo and in vitro pre-clinical laboratory 
      studies. In this review, we critically evaluate the evidence that metformin has 
      cardioprotective actions and assess whether the clinical and pre-clinical 
      evidence support the use of metformin to reduce the risk and treat AF.

AB  - An in silico consensus molecular docking approach and in vitro evaluations were 
      adopted in the present study to explore a dataset of FDA-approved drugs as novel 
      multitarget MAO-B/AChE agents in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). GOLD 
      5.3 and Glide were employed in the virtual assessments and consensus 
      superimpositions of the obtained poses were applied to increase the reliability 
      of the docking protocols. Furthermore, the top ranked molecules were subjected to 
      binding free energy calculations using MM/GBSA, Induced fit docking (IFD) 
      simulations, and a literature review. Consequently, the top four multitarget 
      drugs were examined for their in vitro MAO-B and AChE inhibition effects. The 
      consensus molecular docking identified Dolutegravir, Rebamipide, Loracarbef and 
      Diflunisal as potential multitarget drugs. The biological data demonstrated that 
      most of the docking scores were in good correlation with the in vitro 
      experiments, however the theoretical simulations in the active site of MAO-B 
      identified two false-positives - Rebamipide and Diflunisal. Dolutegravir and 
      Loracarbef were accessed as active MAO-B inhibitors, while Dolutegravir, 
      Rebamapide and Diflunisal as potential AChE inhibitors. The antiretroviral agent 
      Dolutegravir exhibited the most potent multitarget activity - 41% inhibition of 
      MAO-B (1 μM) and 68% inhibition of AChE (10 μM). Visualizations of the 
      intermolecular interactions of Dolutegravir in the active sites of MAO-B and AChE 
      revealed the formation of several stable hydrogen bonds. Overall, Dolutegravir 
      was identified as a potential anti-AD drug, however further in vivo evaluations 
      should be considered.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Notwithstanding the huge 
      investments in drug development, only one disease-modifying treatment has been 
      recently approved. Here we present a single-cell-led systems biology pipeline for 
      the identification of drug repurposing candidates. Using single-cell RNA 
      sequencing data of brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer's disease, 
      genome-wide association study results, and multiple gene annotation resources, we 
      built a multi-cellular Alzheimer's disease molecular network that we leveraged

AB  - Clinical trials of novel therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have consumed 
      a significant amount of time and resources with largely negative results. 
      Repurposing drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
      European Medicines Agency (EMA), or Worldwide for another indication is a more 
      rapid and less expensive option. Therefore, we apply the scaffold searching 
      approach based on known amyloid-beta (Aβ) inhibitor tramiprosate to screen the 
      DrugCentral database (n = 4,642) of clinically tested drugs. As a result, 
      menadione bisulfite and camphotamide substances with protrombogenic and 
      neurostimulation/cardioprotection effects were identified as promising Aβ 
      inhibitors with an improved binding affinity (ΔGbind) and blood-brain barrier 
      permeation (logBB). Finally, the data was also confirmed by molecular dynamics 
      simulations using implicit solvation, in particular as Molecular Mechanics 
      Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) model. Overall, the proposed in silico 
      pipeline can be implemented through the early stage rational drug design to 
      nominate some lead candidates for AD, which will be further validated in vitro 
      and in vivo, and, finally, in a clinical trial.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the biggest human health threats due to 
      increases in aging of the global population. Unfortunately, drugs for treating AD 
      have been largely ineffective. Interestingly, downregulation of macroautophagy 
      (autophagy) plays an essential role in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, targeting 
      autophagy has drawn considerable attention as a therapeutic approach for the 
      treatment of AD. However, developing new therapeutics is time-consuming and 
      requires huge investments. One of the strategies currently under consideration 
      for many diseases is "drug repositioning" or "drug repurposing". In this 
      comprehensive review, we have provided an overview of the impact of autophagy on 
      AD pathophysiology, reviewed the therapeutics that upregulate autophagy and are 
      currently used in the treatment of other diseases, including cancers, and 
      evaluated their repurposing as a possible treatment option for AD. In addition, 
      we discussed the potential of applying nano-drug delivery to neurodegenerative 
      diseases, such as AD, to overcome the challenge of crossing the blood brain 
      barrier and specifically target molecules/pathways of interest with minimal side 
      effects.

TI  - Modeling Path Importance for Effective Alzheimer's Disease Drug Repurposing.
PG  - 306-321
AB  - Recently, drug repurposing has emerged as an effective and resource-efficient 
      paradigm for AD drug discovery. Among various methods for drug repurposing, 
      network-based methods have shown promising results as they are capable of 
      leveraging complex networks that integrate multiple interaction types, such as 
      protein-protein interactions, to more effectively identify candidate drugs. 
      However, existing approaches typically assume paths of the same length in the 
      network have equal importance in identifying the therapeutic effect of drugs. 
      Other domains have found that same length paths do not necessarily have the same 
      importance. Thus, relying on this assumption may be deleterious to drug 
      repurposing attempts. In this work, we propose MPI (Modeling Path Importance), a 
      novel network-based method for AD drug repurposing. MPI is unique in that it 
      prioritizes important paths via learned node embeddings, which can effectively 
      capture a network's rich structural information. Thus, leveraging learned 
      embeddings allows MPI to effectively differentiate the importance among paths. We 
      evaluate MPI against a commonly used baseline method that identifies anti-AD drug 
      candidates primarily based on the shortest paths between drugs and AD in the 
      network. We observe that among the top-50 ranked drugs, MPI prioritizes 20.0% 
      more drugs with anti-AD evidence compared to the baseline. Finally, Cox 
      proportional-hazard models produced from insurance claims data aid us in 
      identifying the use of etodolac, nicotine, and BBB-crossing ACE-INHs as having a 
      reduced risk of AD, suggesting such drugs may be viable candidates for 
      repurposing and should be explored further in future studies.

TI  - Discovering new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by repurposing approved 
      medications.
PG  - 2306-27
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and a major cause 
      of morbidity and mortality. The greatest risk factor for AD is age and as many 
      countries are experiencing an aging population, the expected rise in AD threatens 
      to have serious medical and socioeconomic impact in the coming decades. The only 
      approved medications for AD are symptomatic and there are no currently available 
      disease modifying treatments. Hence, a disease modifying treatment is desperately 
      needed for AD not only for proper care and management of affected patients, but 
      also to reduce society's socioeconomic burden. Developing novel compounds for any 
      indication is a time, effort, and money consuming endeavor and most treatments 
      never make it to market. Other research and development strategies are needed, 
      especially for the treatment of AD. We provide a review of the current literature 
      in assessing possibilities of repurposing medications currently used for non-AD 
      indications. Many different compounds from many different pharmacological classes 
      have already been studied in an AD context. We provide a "pragmatic drug 
      repurposing score" for each of these compounds based on type of studies 
      conducted, number of possible mechanisms of action, efficacy in AD and other 
      neurodegenerative disease studies, tolerability profile, and their ability to 
      cross the blood brain barrier. The current data suggest several compounds worthy 
      of further study as treatments for AD. Compounds with the highest scores include 
      lithium, minocycline, exenatide, valproic acid, methylene blue, and nicotine.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and a 
      major global health issue. Currently, only limited treatment options are 
      available to patients. One possibility to expand the treatment repertoire is 
      repurposing of existing drugs such as dimethyl fumarate (DMF). DMF is approved 
      for treatment of multiple sclerosis and previous animal studies have suggested 
      that DMF may also have a beneficial effect for the treatment of AD. METHODS: We 
      used an APPPS1 transgenic model of senile β-amyloidosis and treated female mice 
      orally with DMF in two treatment paradigms (pre and post onset). We quantified 
      learning and memory parameters, β-amyloidosis, and neuroinflammation to determine 
      the potential of DMF as AD therapeutics. RESULTS: Treatment with DMF had no 
      influence on water maze performance, β-amyloid accumulation, plaque formation, 
      microglia activation, and recruitment of immune cells to the brain. Compared to 
      vehicle-treated animals, oral DMF treatment could not halt or retard disease 
      progression in the mice. DISCUSSION: Our results do not favour the use of DMF as 
      treatment for AD. While our results stand in contrast to previous findings in 
      other models, they emphasize the importance of animal model selection and suggest 
      further studies to elucidate the mechanisms leading to conflicting results.

AB  - Hyperlipidemia causes diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, Type II 
      Diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Drugs that specifically target HL associated 
      diseases are required for treatment. 34 KEGG pathways targeted by lipid lowering 
      drugs were used to construct a directed protein-protein interaction network and 
      driver nodes were determined using CytoCtrlAnalyser plugin of Cytoscape 3.6. The 
      involvement of driver nodes of HL in other diseases was verified using GWAS. The 
      central nodes of the network and 34 overrepresented pathways had a critical role 
      in Hyperlipidemia. The PI3K-AKT signalling pathway, non-essentiality, 
      non-centrality and approved drug target status were the predominant features of 
      the driver nodes. Next, a Random Forest classifier was trained on 1445 molecular 
      descriptors calculated using PaDEL for 50 approved lipid lowering and 84 lipid 
      raising drugs as the positive and negative training set respectively. The 
      classifier showed average accuracy of 76.8 % during 5-fold cross validation with 
      AUC of 0.79 ± 0.06 for the ROC curve. The classifier was applied to select 
      molecules with favourable properties for lipid lowering from the 130 approved 
      drugs interacting with the identified driver nodes. We have integrated diverse 
      network data and machine learning to predict repurposing of nine drugs for 
      treatment of HL associated diseases.

PG  - 833-46
LID - 10.1038/nrd3869 [doi]
AB  - Existing drugs for Alzheimer's disease provide symptomatic benefit for up to 12 
      months, but there are no approved disease-modifying therapies. Given the recent 
      failures of various novel disease-modifying therapies in clinical trials, a 
      complementary strategy based on repositioning drugs that are approved for other 
      indications could be attractive. Indeed, a substantial body of preclinical work 
      indicates that several classes of such drugs have potentially beneficial effects 
      on Alzheimer's-like brain pathology, and for some drugs the evidence is also 
      supported by epidemiological data or preliminary clinical trials. Here, we 
      present a formal consensus evaluation of these opportunities, based on a 
      systematic review of published literature. We highlight several compounds for 
      which sufficient evidence is available to encourage further investigation to 
      clarify an optimal dose and consider progression to clinical trials in patients 
      with Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Repositioning drugs for traumatic brain injury - N-acetyl cysteine and

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of morbidity and 
      mortality of both young adults of less than 45 years of age and the elderly, and 
      contributes to about 30% of all injury deaths in the United States of America. 
      Whereas there has been a significant improvement in our understanding of the 
      mechanism that underpin the primary and secondary stages of damage associated 
      with a TBI incident, to date however, this knowledge has not translated into the 
      development of effective new pharmacological TBI treatment strategies. Prior 
      experimental and clinical studies of drugs working via a single mechanism only 
      may have failed to address the full range of pathologies that lead to the 
      neuronal loss and cognitive impairment evident in TBI and other disorders. The 
      present review focuses on two drugs with the potential to benefit multiple 
      pathways considered important in TBI. Notably, both agents have already been 
      developed into human studies for other conditions, and thus have the potential to 
      be rapidly repositioned as TBI therapies. The first is N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) 
      that is currently used in over the counter medications for its anti-inflammatory 
      properties. The second is (-)-phenserine ((-)-Phen) that was originally developed 
      as an experimental Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug. We briefly review background 
      information about TBI and subsequently review literature suggesting that NAC and 
      (-)-Phen may be useful therapeutic approaches for TBI, for which there are no 
      currently approved drugs.

AB  - Disruption or loss of oligodendrocytes (OLs) and myelin has devastating effects 
      on CNS function and integrity, which occur in diverse neurological disorders, 
      including Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease and neuropsychiatric 
      disorders. Hence, there is a need to develop new therapies that promote 
      oligodendrocyte regeneration and myelin repair. A promising approach is drug 
      repurposing, but most agents have potentially contrasting biological actions 
      depending on the cellular context and their dose-dependent effects on 
      intracellular pathways. Here, we have used a combined systems biology and 
      neurobiological approach to identify compounds that exert positive and negative 
      effects on oligodendroglia, depending on concentration. Notably, next generation 
      pharmacogenomic analysis identified the PI3K/Akt modulator LY294002 as the most 
      highly ranked small molecule with both pro- and anti-oligodendroglial 
      concentration-dependent effects. We validated these in silico findings using 
      multidisciplinary approaches to reveal a profoundly bipartite effect of LY294002 
      on the generation of OPCs and their differentiation into myelinating 
      oligodendrocytes in both postnatal and adult contexts. Finally, we employed 
      transcriptional profiling and signalling pathway activity assays to determine 
      cell-specific mechanisms of action of LY294002 on oligodendrocytes and resolve 
      optimal in vivo conditions required to promote myelin repair. These results 
      demonstrate the power of multidisciplinary strategies in determining the 
      therapeutic potential of small molecules in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Cytokine signaling, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and 
      interleukin (IL)-6, through the Janus-kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and 
      activator of transcription pathway, was hypothesized to attenuate the risk of 
      Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the Drug Repurposing for 
      Effective Alzheimer Medicines (DREAM) initiative based on multiomics phenotyping. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between treatment with tofacitinib, 
      tocilizumab, or TNF inhibitors compared with abatacept and risk of incident ADRD. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted among US 
      Medicare fee-for-service patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 65 years and 
      older from 2007 to 2017. Patients were categorized into 3 cohorts based on 
      initiation of tofacitinib (a JAK inhibitor), tocilizumab (an IL-6 inhibitor), or 
      TNF inhibitors compared with a common comparator abatacept (a T-cell activation 
      inhibitor). Analyses were conducted from August 2020 to August 2021. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was onset of ADRD based on diagnosis 
      codes evaluated in 4 alternative analysis schemes: (1) an as-treated follow-up 
      approach, (2) an as-started follow-up approach incorporating a 6-month induction 
      period, (3) incorporating a 6-month symptom to diagnosis period to account for 
      misclassification of ADRD onset, and (4) identifying ADRD through symptomatic 
      prescriptions and diagnosis codes. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were 
      calculated from Cox proportional hazard regression after adjustment for 79 
      preexposure characteristics through propensity score matching. RESULTS: After 1:1 
      propensity score matching to patients using abatacept, a total of 22 569 
      propensity score-matched patient pairs, including 4224 tofacitinib pairs (mean 
      [SD] age 72.19 [5.65] years; 6945 [82.2%] women), 6369 tocilizumab pairs (mean 
      [SD] age 72.01 [5.46] years; 10 105 [79.4%] women), and 11 976 TNF inhibitor 
      pairs (mean [SD] age 72.67 [5.91] years; 19 710 [82.3%] women), were assessed. 
      Incidence rates of ADRD varied from 2 to 18 per 1000 person-years across analyses 
      schemes. There were no statistically significant associations of ADRD with 
      tofacitinib (analysis 1: HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.55-1.51]; analysis 2: HR, 0.78 [95% 
      CI, 0.53-1.13]; analysis 3: HR, 1.29 [95% CI, 0.72-2.33]; analysis 4: HR, 0.50 
      [95% CI, 0.21-1.20]), tocilizumab (analysis 1: HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.55-1.21]; 
      analysis 2: HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.81-1.35]; analysis 3: HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 
      0.75-1.96]; analysis 4: HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.44-1.39]), or TNF inhibitors 
      (analysis 1: HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.72-1.20]; analysis 2: HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 
      0.86-1.20]; analysis 3: HR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.86-1.48]; analysis 4: 0.90 [95% CI, 
      0.60-1.37]) compared with abatacept. Results from prespecified subgroup analysis 
      by age, sex, and baseline cardiovascular disease were consistent except in 
      patients with cardiovascular disease, for whom there was a potentially lower risk 
      of ADRD with TNF inhibitors vs abatacept, but only in analyses 2 and 4 (analysis 
      1: HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.50-1.16]; analysis 2: HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56-0.99]; 
      analysis 3: HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.65-1.61]; analysis 4: HR, 0.45 [95% CI, 
      0.21-0.98]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study did not find any 
      association of risk of ADRD in patients treated with tofacitinib, tocilizumab, or 
      TNF inhibitors compared with abatacept.

AB  - Although more than 100 years have passed since Alois Alzheimer reported a case of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), a definitive answer to the causes of cognitive 
      impairment in the disease remains elusive. Despite significant enthusiasm and 
      investment from the pharmaceutical industry, clinical trials of many 
      disease-modifying drugs for AD have been largely unsuccessful. Drug repositioning 
      (DR) or repurposing approaches are relatively inexpensive and more reliable 
      compared to de novo drug development in AD. About 30% of clinical trials for AD 
      in progress around the world use the DR method and hold potential in halting the 
      current deadlock in treatment options. By using drugs approved for other 
      indications, these clinical trials target dysregulated pathways in AD with 
      different or a combination of modes of action, including anti-amyloid, 
      cardiovascular, anti-tau, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, metabolic, 
      neuroprotective, and neurotransmission-based approaches. For instance, 
      anti-diabetic drugs, such as insulin, metformin, liraglutide, and dapagliflozin, 
      and cardiovascular drugs, such as cilostazol, candesartan, telmisartan, prazosin, 
      and dabigatran, could serendipitously provide previously unearthed benefits in 
      AD. This is in line with recent thinking, which views AD as a complex 
      multifactorial disorder, not dominated by one dominant biological factor, such as 
      amyloid-β, and likely a confluence of many pathobiological mechanisms, including 
      vascular dysregulation. Such increasingly available knowledge of phenotyping may 
      be used to design 'tailor-made' DR and relatively homogeneous AD subpopulations 
      specifically targeted with existing drugs based on known modes of action. It is 
      thus expected that DR approaches will create a major paradigm shift in AD 
      research and development.

AB  - To date, all clinical trials of disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) have been unsuccessful, making investments into AD drug development very 
      risky despite the high unmet need. Drug repositioning or repurposing approaches 
      are relatively less expensive and more promising compared to novel drug 
      development in AD. About 40% of clinical trials for AD currently in progress 
      across the world use the drug repositioning method. They are expected to be a 
      trigger for AD drug discovery that breaks the current deadlock situation. By 
      using drugs approved for other indications, these clinical trials target 
      dysregulated pathways of AD with different or a combination of modes of action, 
      including anti-amyloid, anti-tau, anti-inflammatory, metabolic, neuroprotective, 
      and neurotransmission-based approaches. In these clinical trials, cardiovascular 
      drugs such as insulin, cilostazol, probucol, telmisartan, and dabigatran are 
      tested for their effect on different mechanisms of AD pathology. This is in line 
      with the recent emphasis that AD should be studied as a complex multifactorial 
      disorder, not dominated by one dominant biological factor such as beta-amyloid, 
      and without disregarding any relevant pathologic factor, such as vascular 
      dysregulation. It is strongly expected that drug repositioning approaches will 
      create a paradigm shift in treatment approaches for AD patients.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) activity has significant 
      implications for the development of novel therapeutic modalities against 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Although PPAR-α, PPAR-β/δ, and PPAR-γ nuclear 
      receptor expressions are significantly reported in the brain, their implications 
      in brain physiology and other neurodegenerative diseases still require extensive 
      studies. PPAR signaling can modulate various cell signaling mechanisms involved 
      in the cells contributing to on- and off-target actions selectively to promote 
      therapeutic effects as well as the adverse effects of PPAR ligands. Both natural 
      and synthetic ligands for the PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARβ/δ have been reported. PPARα 
      (WY 14.643) and PPARγ agonists can confer neuroprotection by modulating 
      mitochondrial dynamics through the redox system. The pharmacological effect of 
      these agonists may deliver effective clinical responses by protecting vulnerable 
      neurons from Aβ toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Therefore, the 
      current review delineated the ligands' interaction with 3D-PPARs to modulate 
      neuroprotection, and also deciphered the efficacy of numerous drugs, viz. Aβ 
      aggregation inhibitors, vaccines, and γ-secretase inhibitors against AD; this 
      review elucidated the role of PPAR and their receptor isoforms in neural systems, 
      and neurodegeneration in human beings. Further, we have substantially discussed 
      the efficacy of PPREs as potent transcription factors in the brain, and the role 
      of PPAR agonists in neurotransmission, PPAR gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and 
      mitochondrial dynamics in neuroprotection during AD conditions. This review 
      concludes with the statement that the development of novel PPARs agonists may 
      benefit patients with neurodegeneration, mainly AD patients, which may help 
      mitigate the pathophysiology of dementia, subsequently improving overall the 
      patient's quality of life.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder and the 
      most common cause of cognitive decline. The alarming epidemiological features of 
      Alzheimer's disease, combined with the high failure rate of candidate drugs 
      tested in the preclinical phase, impose more intense investigations for new 
      curative treatments. NRF2 (Nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2) 
      plays a critical role in the inflammatory response and in the cellular redox 
      homeostasis and provides cytoprotection in several diseases including those in 
      the neurodegeneration spectrum. These roles suggest that NRF2 and its directly 
      associated proteins may be novel attractive therapeutic targets in the fight 
      against AD. In this study, through a systemics perspective, we propose an in 
      silico drug repurposing approach for AD, based on the NRF2 interactome and 
      regulome, with the aim of highlighting possible repurposed drugs for AD. Using 
      publicly available information based on differential expressions of the 
      NRF2-neighborhood in AD and through a computational drug repurposing pipeline, we 
      derived to a short list of candidate repurposed drugs and small molecules that 
      affect the expression levels of the majority of NRF2-partners. The relevance of 
      these findings was assessed in a four-step computational meta-analysis including 
      i) structural similarity comparisons with currently ongoing NRF2-related drugs in 
      clinical trials ii) evaluation based on the NRF2-diseasome iii) comparison of 
      relevance between targeted pathways of shortlisted drugs and NRF2-related drugs 
      in clinical trials and iv) further comparison with existing knowledge on AD and 
      NRF2-related drugs in clinical trials based on their known modes of action. 
      Overall, our analysis yielded in 5 candidate repurposed drugs for AD. In cell 
      culture, these 5 candidates activated a luciferase reporter for NRF2 activity and 
      in hippocampus derived TH22 cells they increased NRF2 protein levels and the NRF2 
      transcriptional signatures as determined by increased expression of its 
      downstream target heme oxygenase 1. We expect that our proposed candidate 
      repurposed drugs will be useful for further research and clinical translation for 
      AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite numerous clinical trials and decades of endeavour, there is 
      still no effective cure for Alzheimer's disease. Computational drug repositioning 
      approaches may be employed for the development of new treatment strategies for 
      Alzheimer's patients since an extensive amount of omics data has been generated 
      during pre-clinical and clinical studies. However, targeting the most critical 
      pathophysiological mechanisms and determining drugs with proper pharmacodynamics 
      and good efficacy are equally crucial in drug repurposing and often imbalanced in 
      Alzheimer's studies. METHODS: Here, we investigated central co-expressed genes 
      upregulated in Alzheimer's disease to determine a proper therapeutic target. We 
      backed our reasoning by checking the target gene's estimated non-essentiality for 
      survival in multiple human tissues. We screened transcriptome profiles of various 
      human cell lines perturbed by drug induction (for 6798 compounds) and gene 
      knockout using data available in the Connectivity Map database. Then, we applied 
      a profile-based drug repositioning approach to discover drugs targeting the 
      target gene based on the correlations between these transcriptome profiles. We 
      evaluated the bioavailability, functional enrichment profiles and drug-protein 
      interactions of these repurposed agents and evidenced their cellular viability 
      and efficacy in glial cell culture by experimental assays and Western blotting. 
      Finally, we evaluated their pharmacokinetics to anticipate to which degree their 
      efficacy can be improved. RESULTS: We identified glutaminase as a promising drug 
      target. Glutaminase overexpression may fuel the glutamate excitotoxicity in 
      neurons, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and other neurodegeneration 
      hallmark processes. The computational drug repurposing revealed eight drugs: 
      mitoxantrone, bortezomib, parbendazole, crizotinib, withaferin-a, SA-25547 and 
      two unstudied compounds. We demonstrated that the proposed drugs could 
      effectively suppress glutaminase and reduce glutamate production in the diseased 
      brain through multiple neurodegeneration-associated mechanisms, including 
      cytoskeleton and proteostasis. We also estimated the human blood-brain barrier 
      permeability of parbendazole and SA-25547 using the SwissADME tool. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study method effectively identified an Alzheimer's disease marker and 
      compounds targeting the marker and interconnected biological processes by use of 
      multiple computational approaches. Our results highlight the importance of 
      synaptic glutamate signalling in Alzheimer's disease progression. We suggest 
      repurposable drugs (like parbendazole) with well-evidenced activities that we 
      linked to glutamate synthesis hereby and novel molecules (SA-25547) with 
      estimated mechanisms for the treatment of Alzheimer's patients.

AB  - The complex molecular mechanism and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      limits the development of effective therapeutics or prevention strategies. 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI)-guided drug discovery combined with 
      genetics/multi-omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
      metabolomics) analysis contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiology 
      and precision medicine of the disease, including AD and AD-related dementia. In 
      this review, we summarize the AI-driven methodologies for AD-agnostic drug 
      discovery and development, including de novo drug design, virtual screening, and 
      prediction of drug-target interactions, all of which have shown potentials. In 
      particular, AI-based drug repurposing emerges as a compelling strategy to 
      identify new indications for existing drugs for AD. We provide several emerging 
      AD targets from human genetics and multi-omics findings and highlight recent 
      AI-based technologies and their applications in drug discovery using AD as a 
      prototypical example. In closing, we discuss future challenges and directions in 
      AI-based drug discovery for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative 
      condition with few treatment options available. Drug repurposing studies have 
      sought to identify existing drugs that could be repositioned to treat AD; 
      however, the effectiveness of drug repurposing for AD remains unclear. This 
      review systematically analyzes the progress made in drug repurposing for AD 
      throughout the last decade, summarizing the suggested drug candidates and 
      analyzing changes in the repurposing strategies used over time. We also examine 
      the different types of data that have been leveraged to validate suggested drug 
      repurposing candidates for AD, which to our knowledge has not been previous 
      investigated, although this information may be especially useful in appraising 
      the potential of suggested drug repurposing candidates. We ultimately hope to 
      gain insight into the suggested drugs representing the most promising repurposing 
      candidates for AD. Methods: We queried the PubMed database for AD drug 
      repurposing studies published between 2012 and 2022. 124 articles were reviewed. 
      We used RxNorm to standardize drug names across the reviewed studies, map drugs 
      to their constituent ingredients, and identify prescribable drugs. We used the 
      Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System to group drugs. 
      Results: 573 unique drugs were proposed for repurposing in AD over the last 
      10 years. These suggested repurposing candidates included drugs acting on the 
      nervous system (17%), antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (16%), and drugs 
      acting on the cardiovascular system (12%). Clozapine, a second-generation 
      antipsychotic medication, was the most frequently suggested repurposing candidate 
      (N = 6). 61% (76/124) of the reviewed studies performed a validation, yet only 4% 
      (5/124) used real-world data for validation. Conclusion: A large number of 
      potential drug repurposing candidates for AD has accumulated over the last 
      decade. However, among these drugs, no single drug has emerged as the top 
      candidate, making it difficult to establish research priorities. Validation of 
      drug repurposing hypotheses is inconsistently performed, and real-world data has 
      been critically underutilized for validation. Given the urgent need for new AD 
      therapies, the utility of real-world data in accelerating identification of 
      high-priority candidates for AD repurposing warrants further investigation.

AB  - Despite the increasing global burden of neurological disorders, there is a lack 
      of effective diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Proteins are often 
      dysregulated in disease and have a strong genetic component. Here, we carry out a 
      protein quantitative trait locus analysis of 184 neurologically-relevant 
      proteins, using whole genome sequencing data from two isolated population-based 
      cohorts (N = 2893). In doing so, we elucidate the genetic landscape of the 
      circulating proteome and its connection to neurological disorders. We detect 214 
      independently-associated variants for 107 proteins, the majority of which (76%) 
      are cis-acting, including 114 variants that have not been previously identified. 
      Using two-sample Mendelian randomisation, we identify causal associations between 
      serum CD33 and Alzheimer's disease, GPNMB and Parkinson's disease, and MSR1 and 
      schizophrenia, describing their clinical potential and highlighting drug 
      repurposing opportunities.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the recent full FDA approval of lecanemab, there is 
      currently no disease modifying therapy (DMT) that can efficiently slow down the 
      progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the general population. This statement 
      emphasizes the need to identify novel DMTs in the shortest time possible to 
      prevent a global epidemic of AD cases as the world population experiences an 
      increase in lifespan. AREAS COVERED: Here, we review several classes of 
      anti-cancer drugs that have been or are being investigated in Phase II/III 
      clinical trials for AD, including immunomodulatory drugs, RXR agonists, sex 
      hormone therapies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies. EXPERT 
      OPINION: Given the overall course of brain pathologies during the progression of 
      AD, we express a great enthusiasm for the repositioning of anti-cancer drugs as 
      possible AD DMTs. We anticipate an increasing number of combinatorial therapy 
      strategies to tackle AD symptoms and their underlying pathologies. However, we 
      strongly encourage improvements in clinical trial study designs to better assess 
      target engagement and possible efficacy over sufficient periods of drug exposure.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of morbidity among trauma 
      patients; however, an effective pharmacological treatment has not yet been 
      approved. Individuals with TBI are at greater risk of developing neurological 
      illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The 
      approval process for treatments can be accelerated by repurposing known drugs to 
      treat the growing number of patients with TBI. This review focuses on the 
      repurposing of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a drug currently approved to treat 
      hepatotoxic overdose of acetaminophen. NAC also has antioxidant and 
      anti-inflammatory properties that may be suitable for use in therapeutic 
      treatments for TBI. Minocycline (MINO), a tetracycline antibiotic, has been shown 
      to be effective in combination with NAC in preventing oligodendrocyte damage. 
      (-)-phenserine (PHEN), an anti-acetylcholinesterase agent with additional 
      non-cholinergic neuroprotective/neurotrophic properties initially developed to 
      treat AD, has demonstrated efficacy in treating TBI. Recent literature indicates 
      that NAC, MINO, and PHEN may serve as worthwhile repositioned therapeutics in 
      treating TBI.

      Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor 
      deficits induced by dopaminergic neuronal death in the substantia nigra (SN). 
      Finding a successful neuroprotective therapy is still challenging despite 
      improved knowledge of the etiology of PD and a variety of medications intended to 
      reduce symptoms. Lapatinib (LAP), an FDA-approved anti-cancer medication, has 
      been stated to exert its effect through the modulation of oxidative stress. 
      Furthermore, recent studies display the neuroprotective effects of LAP in 
      epilepsy, encephalomyelitis, and Alzheimer's disease in rodent models through the 
      modulation of oxidative stress and ferroptosis. Nevertheless, it is questionable 
      whether LAP exerts neuroprotective effects in PD. In the current study, 
      administration of 100 mg/kg LAP in rotenone-treated rats for 21 days ameliorates 
      motor impairment, debilitated histopathological alterations, and revived 
      dopaminergic neurons by increasing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in SN, 
      along with increased dopamine level. LAP remarkably restored the antioxidant 
      defense mechanism system, GPX4/GSH/NRF2 axis, inhibiting oxidative markers, 
      including iron, TfR1, PTGS2, and 4-HNE, along with suppression of 
      p-EGFR/c-SRC/PKCβII/PLC-γ/ACSL-4 pathway. Moreover, LAP modulates HSP90/CDC37 
      chaperone complex, regulating many key pathological markers of PD, including 
      LRRK2, c-ABL, and α-syn. It is concluded that LAP has neuroprotective effects in 
      PD via modulation of many key parameters implicated in PD pathogenesis. Taken 
      together, the current study offers insights into the potential repositioning of 
      LAP as a disease-modifying drug in PD.

TI  - Medication-Wide Association Study Plus (MWAS+): A Proof of Concept Study on Drug 
      Repurposing.
LID - 10.3390/medsci10030048 [doi]
LID - 48
AB  - The high cost and time for developing a new drug or repositioning a 
      partially-developed drug has fueled interest in "repurposing" drugs. Drug 
      repurposing is particularly of interest for Alzheimer's disease (AD) or 
      AD-related dementias (ADRD) because there are no unrestricted disease-modifying 
      treatments for ADRD. We have designed and pilot tested a 3-Step Medication-Wide 
      Association Study Plus (MWAS+) approach to rigorously accelerate the 
      identification of drugs with a high potential to be repurposed for delaying and 
      preventing AD/ADRD: Step 1 is a hypothesis-free exploration; Step 2 is 
      mechanistic filtering; And Step 3 is hypothesis testing using observational data 
      and prospective cohort design. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of the 
      MWAS+ approach. The Step 1 analysis identified potential candidate drugs 
      including atorvastatin and GLP1. The literature search in Step 2 found evidence 
      supporting the mechanistic plausibility of the statin-ADRD association. Finally, 
      Step 3 confirmed our hypothesis that statin may lower the risk of incident ADRD, 
      which was statistically significant using a target trial design that emulated 
      randomized controlled trials.

AB  - There is a large unmet medical need to find disease modifying therapies against 
      neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes data indicating that insulin 
      resistance occurs in neurodegeneration and strategies to normalize insulin 
      sensitivity in neurons may provide neuroprotective actions. In particular, recent 
      preclinical and clinical studies in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease 
      have indicated that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) agonism and dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 inhibition may exert neuroprotection. Mechanistic insights from these 
      studies and future directions for drug development against neurodegeneration 
      based on GLP1 agonism are discussed.

TI  - Adera2.0: A Drug Repurposing Workflow for Neuroimmunological Investigations Using 
      Neural Networks.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27196453 [doi]
LID - 6453
AB  - Drug repurposing in the context of neuroimmunological (NI) investigations is 
      still in its primary stages. Drug repurposing is an important method that 
      bypasses lengthy drug discovery procedures and focuses on discovering new usages 
      for known medications. Neuroimmunological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, 
      Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and depression, include various pathologies that 
      result from the interaction between the central nervous system and the immune 
      system. However, the repurposing of NI medications is hindered by the vast amount 
      of information that needs mining. We previously presented Adera1.0, which was 
      capable of text mining PubMed for answering query-based questions. However, 
      Adera1.0 was not able to automatically identify chemical compounds within 
      relevant sentences. To challenge the need for repurposing known medications for 
      neuroimmunological diseases, we built a deep neural network named Adera2.0 to 
      perform drug repurposing. The workflow uses three deep learning networks. The 
      first network is an encoder and its main task is to embed text into matrices. The 
      second network uses a mean squared error (MSE) loss function to predict answers 
      in the form of embedded matrices. The third network, which constitutes the main 
      novelty in our updated workflow, also uses a MSE loss function. Its main usage is 
      to extract compound names from relevant sentences resulting from the previous 
      network. To optimize the network function, we compared eight different designs. 
      We found that a deep neural network consisting of an RNN neural network and a 
      leaky ReLU could achieve 0.0001 loss and 67% sensitivity. Additionally, we 
      validated Adera2.0's ability to predict NI drug usage against the DRUG 
      Repurposing Hub database. These results establish the ability of Adera2.0 to 
      repurpose drug candidates that can shorten the development of the drug cycle. The 
      workflow could be download online.

TI  - Treatment with Blackberry Extract and Metformin in Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease 
      Model: Impact on Memory, Inflammation, Redox Status, Phosphorylated Tau Protein 
      and Insulin Signaling.
LID - 10.1007/s12035-024-04062-2 [doi]
AB  - Natural products offer promising potential for the development of new therapies 
      for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blackberry fruits are rich in phytochemical 
      compounds capable of modulating pathways involved in neuroprotection. 
      Additionally, drug repurposing and repositioning could also accelerate the 
      development of news treatments for AD. In light of the reduced brain glucose 
      metabolism in AD, an alternative approach has been the use of the drug metformin. 
      Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with 
      blackberry extract in a model of AD induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and compare 
      it with metformin treatment. Male rats were divided into groups: I - Control; 
      II - STZ; III - STZ + blackberry extract (100 mg/kg); IV - STZ + blackberry 
      extract (200 mg/kg) and V - STZ + metformin (150 mg/kg). The animals received 
      intracerebroventricular injection of STZ or buffer. Seven days after the surgical 
      procedure, the animals were treated orally with blackberry extract or metformin 
      for 21 days. Blackberry extract and metformin prevented the memory impairment 
      induced by STZ. In animals of group II, an increase in acetylcholinesterase 
      activity, phosphorylated tau protein, IL-6, oxidative damage, and gene expression 
      of GSK-3β and Nrf2 was observed in the hippocampus. STZ induced a decrease in 
      IL-10 levels and down-regulated the gene expression of Akt1, IRS-1 and FOXO3a. 
      Blackberry extract and metformin prevented the alterations in 
      acetylcholinesterase activity, IL-6, GSK3β, Nrf2, and oxidative damage. In 
      conclusion, blackberry extract exhibits multi-target actions in a model of AD, 
      suggesting new therapeutic potentials for this neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - Drug repositioning approaches for the discovery of new therapeutics for 
      Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 132-42

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and represents one 
      of the highest unmet needs in medicine today. Drug development efforts for AD 
      have been encumbered by largely unsuccessful clinical trials in the last decade. 
      Drug repositioning, a process of discovering a new therapeutic use for existing 
      drugs or drug candidates, is an attractive and timely drug development strategy 
      especially for AD. Compared with traditional de novo drug development, time and 
      cost are reduced as the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of most 
      repositioning candidates have already been determined. A majority of drug 
      repositioning efforts for AD have been based on positive clinical or 
      epidemiological observations or in vivo efficacy found in mouse models of AD. 
      More systematic, multidisciplinary approaches will further facilitate drug 
      repositioning for AD. Some experimental approaches include unbiased phenotypic 
      screening using the library of available drug collections in physiologically 
      relevant model systems (e.g. stem cell-derived neurons or glial cells), 
      computational prediction and selection approaches that leverage the accumulating 
      data resulting from RNA expression profiles, and genome-wide association studies. 
      This review will summarize several notable strategies and representative examples 
      of drug repositioning for AD.

AB  - Repositioning or repurposing drugs account for a substantial part of entering 
      approval pipeline drugs, which indicates that drug repositioning has huge market 
      potential and value. Computational technologies such as machine learning methods 
      have accelerated the process of drug repositioning in the last few decades years. 
      The repositioning potential of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) drugs for various 
      diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular diseases 
      have been widely studied. Hence, the related summary about repurposing 
      antidiabetic drugs is of great significance. In this review, we focus on the 
      machine learning methods for the development of new T2DM drugs and give an 
      overview of the repurposing potential of the existing antidiabetic agents.

TI  - Repurposing bromocriptine for Aβ metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (REBRAnD) 
      study: randomised placebo-controlled double-blind comparative trial and 
      open-label extension trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of 
      bromocriptine in Alzheimer's disease with presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common causes of 
      dementia. Pathogenic variants in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene are the most 
      frequent cause of early-onset AD. Medications for patients with AD bearing PSEN1 
      mutation (PSEN1-AD) are limited to symptomatic therapies and no established 
      radical treatments are available. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based drug 
      repurposing identified bromocriptine as a therapeutic candidate for PSEN1-AD. In 
      this study, we used an enrichment strategy with iPSCs to select the study 
      population, and we will investigate the safety and efficacy of an orally 
      administered dose of bromocriptine in patients with PSEN1-AD. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. AD 
      patients with PSEN1 mutations and a Mini Mental State Examination-Japanese score 
      of ≤25 will be randomly assigned, at a 2:1 ratio, to the trial drug or placebo 
      group (≥4 patients in TW-012R and ≥2 patients in placebo). This clinical trial 
      consists of a screening period, double-blind phase (9 months) and extension phase 
      (3 months). The double-blind phase for evaluating the efficacy and safety is 
      composed of the low-dose maintenance period (10 mg/day), high-dose maintenance 
      period (22.5 mg/day) and tapering period of the trial drug. Additionally, there 
      is an open-labelled active drug extension period for evaluating long-term safety. 
      Primary outcomes are safety and efficacy in cognitive and psychological function. 
      Also, exploratory investigations for the efficacy of bromocriptine by 
      neurological scores and biomarkers will be conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      The proposed trial is conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and was 
      approved by the Institutional Review Board (K070). The study results are expected 
      to be disseminated at international or national conferences and published in 
      international journals following the peer-review process. TRIAL REGISTRATION

AB  - As COVID-19 continues, a safe, cost-effective treatment strategy demands 
      continued inquiry. Chronic neuroinflammatory disorders may appear to be of little 
      relevance in this regard; often indolent and progressive disorders characterized 
      by neuroinflammation (such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)) are fundamentally 
      dissimilar in etiology and symptomology to COVID-19's rapid infectivity and 
      pathology. However, the two disorders share extensive pathognomonic features, 
      including at membrane, cytoplasmic, and extracellular levels, culminating in 
      analogous immunogenic destruction of their respective organ parenchyma. We 
      hypothesize that these mechanistic similarities may extent to therapeutic 
      targets, namely that it is conceivable an agent against AD's immunopathy may have 
      efficacy against COVID-19 and vice versa. It is notable that while extensively 
      investigated, no agent has yet demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy 
      against AD's cognitive and memory declines. Yet this very failure has driven the 
      development of numerous agents with strong mechanistic potential and clinical 
      characteristics. Having already approved for clinical trials, these agents may be 
      an expedient starting point in the urgent search for an effective COVID-19 
      therapy. Herein, we review the overlapping Alzheimer's/ COVID-19 targets and 
      theorize several initial platforms.

TI  - β-Secretase-1: In Silico Drug Reposition for Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24098164 [doi]
LID - 8164
AB  - The β-secretase-1 enzyme (BACE-1) performs a key role in the production of 
      beta-Amyloid protein (Aβ), which is associated with the development of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inhibition of BACE-1 has been an important 
      pharmacological strategy in the treatment of this neurodegenerative disease. This 
      study aims to identify new potential candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
      with the help of in silico studies, such as molecular docking and ADME 
      prediction, from a broad list of candidates provided by the DrugBank database. 
      From this analysis, 1145 drugs capable of interacting with the enzyme with a 
      higher coupling energy than Verubecestat were obtained, subsequently only 83 
      presented higher coupling energy than EJ7. Applying the oral route of 
      administration as inclusion criteria, only 41 candidates met this requirement; 
      however, 6 of them are associated with diagnostic tests and not treatment, so 33 
      candidates were obtained. Finally, five candidates were identified as possible 
      BACE-1 inhibitors drugs: Fluphenazine, Naratriptan, Bazedoxifene, Frovatriptan, 
      and Raloxifene. These candidates exhibit pharmacophore-specific features, 
      including the indole or thioindole group, and interactions with key amino acids 
      in BACE-1. Overall, this study provides insights into the potential use of in 
      silico methods for drug repurposing and identification of new candidates for the 
      treatment of Alzheimer's disease, especially those targeting BACE-1.

TI  - Repurposing the KCa3.1 inhibitor senicapoc for Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 723-738
LID - 10.1002/acn3.754 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Microglia play a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). We here tested the therapeutic hypothesis that the 
      Ca(2+)-activated potassium channel KCa3.1 constitutes a potential target for 
      treating AD by reducing neuroinflammation. METHODS: To determine if KCa3.1 is 
      relevant to AD, we tested if treating cultured microglia or hippocampal slices 
      with Aβ oligomer (AβO) activated KCa3.1 in microglia, and if microglial KCa3.1 
      was upregulated in 5xFAD mice and in human AD brains. The expression/activity of 
      KCa3.1 was examined by qPCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and 
      whole-cell patch-clamp. To investigate the role of KCa3.1 in AD pathology, we 
      resynthesized senicapoc, a clinically tested KCa3.1 blocker, and determined its 
      pharmacokinetic properties and its effect on microglial activation, Aβ deposition 
      and hippocampal long-term potentiation (hLTP) in 5xFAD mice. RESULTS: We found 
      markedly enhanced microglial KCa3.1 expression/activity in brains of both 5xFAD 
      mice and AD patients. In hippocampal slices, microglial KCa3.1 
      expression/activity was increased by AβO treatment, and its inhibition diminished 
      the proinflammatory and hLTP-impairing activities of AβO. Senicapoc exhibited 
      excellent brain penetrance and oral availability, and in 5xFAD mice, reduced 
      neuroinflammation, decreased cerebral amyloid load, and enhanced hippocampal 
      neuronal plasticity. INTERPRETATION: Our results prompt us to propose repurposing 
      senicapoc for AD clinical trials, as senicapoc has excellent pharmacological 
      properties and was safe and well-tolerated in a prior phase-3 clinical trial for 
      sickle cell anemia. Such repurposing has the potential to expedite the urgently 
      needed new drug discovery for AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the most 
      common type of dementia. With no disease-curing drugs available and an 
      ever-growing AD-related healthcare burden, novel approaches for identifying 
      therapies are needed. In this work, we propose stage-specific candidate 
      repurposed drugs against AD by using a novel network-based method for drug 
      repurposing against different stages of AD severity. For each AD stage, this 
      approach a) ranks the candidate repurposed drugs based on a novel network-based 
      score emerging from the weighted sum of connections in a network resembling the 
      structural similarity with failed, approved or currently ongoing drugs b) 
      re-ranks the candidate drugs based on functional, structural and a priori 
      information according to a recently developed method by our group and c) checks 
      and re-ranks for permeability through the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). Overall, we 
      propose for further experimental validation 10 candidate repurposed drugs for 
      each AD stage comprising a set of 26 elite candidate repurposed drugs due to 
      overlaps between the three AD stages. We applied our methodology in a 
      retrospective way on the known clinical trial drugs till 2016 and we show that we 
      were able to highly rank a drug that did enter clinical trials in the following 
      year. We expect that our proposed network-based drug-repurposing methodology will 
      serve as a paradigm for application for ranking candidate repurposed drugs in 
      other brain diseases beyond AD.

AB  - Ongoing biomarker development programs have been designed to identify serologic 
      or imaging signatures of clinico-pathologic entities, assuming distinct 
      biological boundaries between them. Identified putative biomarkers have exhibited 
      large variability and inconsistency between cohorts, and remain inadequate for 
      selecting suitable recipients for potential disease-modifying interventions. We 
      launched the Cincinnati Cohort Biomarker Program (CCBP) as a population-based, 
      phenotype-agnostic longitudinal study. While patients affected by a wide range of 
      neurodegenerative disorders will be deeply phenotyped using clinical, imaging, 
      and mobile health technologies, analyses will not be anchored on phenotypic 
      clusters but on bioassays of to-be-repurposed medications as well as on genomics, 
      transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, microbiomics, and 
      pharmacogenomics analyses blinded to phenotypic data. Unique features of this 
      cohort study include (1) a reverse biology-to-phenotype direction of biomarker 
      development in which clinical, imaging, and mobile health technologies are 
      subordinate to biological signals of interest; (2) hypothesis free, causally- and 
      data driven-based analyses; (3) inclusive recruitment of patients with 
      neurodegenerative disorders beyond clinical criteria-meeting patients with 
      Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and (4) a large number of longitudinally 
      followed participants. The parallel development of serum bioassays will be aimed 
      at linking biologically suitable subjects to already available drugs with 
      repurposing potential in future proof-of-concept adaptive clinical trials. 
      Although many challenges are anticipated, including the unclear pathogenic 
      relevance of identifiable biological signals and the possibility that some 
      signals of importance may not yet be measurable with current technologies, this 
      cohort study abandons the anchoring role of clinico-pathologic criteria in favor 
      of biomarker-driven disease subtyping to facilitate future biosubtype-specific 
      disease-modifying therapeutic efforts.

      Angiotensin Receptor Blockers on the Onset of Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 35-45
LID - 10.14283/jarlife.2023.8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The criteria for use of Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug Leqembi 
      recommended by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) include patients aged 65 
      years or older with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD. Comorbidities 
      that include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are common among these 
      patients. OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to investigate the comparative 
      effectiveness of the administration of one, two, or three medications belonging 
      to the categories of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), Beta Blockers, Statins, and Metformin, for their 
      potential to delay the clinical onset of AD and provide a window of opportunity 
      for therapeutic intervention. DESIGN: Retrospective matched case-control study. 
      SETTING: Data from the Department of Veterans Affairs national corporate data 
      warehouse. PARTICIPANTS: We conducted an analysis of 122,351 participants (13,611 
      with AD and 108,740 without AD), aged 65-89, who began at least one of the 
      prescribed medication classes under investigation between October 1998 and April 
      2018. MEASUREMENTS: We utilized Cox proportional hazard regressions, both with 
      and without propensity score weighting, to estimate hazard ratios (HR) associated 
      with the use of different medication combinations for the pre-symptomatic 
      survival time of AD onset. Additionally, we employed a supervised machine 
      learning algorithm (random forest) to assess the relative importance of various 
      therapies in predicting the occurrence of AD. RESULT: Adding Metformin to the 
      combination of ACEI+Beta Blocker (HR = 0.56, 95% CI (0.41, 0.77)) reduced the 
      risk of AD onset compared to ACEI monotherapy alone (HR = 0.91, (0.85, 0.98)), 
      Beta Blocker monotherapy (HR = 0.86, 95% CI (0.80, 0.92)), or combined ACEI+Beta 
      Blocker (HR=0.85, 95%CI (0.77, 0.94)), when statin prescribers were used as a 
      reference. Prescriptions of ARB alone or the combination of ARB with Beta Blocker 
      showed an association with a lower risk of AD onset. CONCLUSION: Selected 
      medications for the treatment of multiple chronic conditions among elderly 
      individuals with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes as monotherapy or 
      combination therapies lengthen the pre-symptomatic period before the onset of AD.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are neuronal problems that include the brain 
      and spinal cord and result in loss of sensory and motor dysfunction. Common NDDs 
      include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease 
      (HD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) etc. The 
      occurrence of these diseases increases with age and is one of the challenging 
      problems among elderly people. Though, several scientific research has 
      demonstrated the key pathologies associated with NDDs still the underlying 
      mechanisms and molecular details are not well understood and need to be explored 
      and this poses a lack of effective treatments for NDDs. Several lines of evidence 
      have shown that NDDs have a high prevalence and affect more than a billion 
      individuals globally but still, researchers need to work forward in identifying 
      the best therapeutic target for NDDs. Thus, several researchers are working in 
      the directions to find potential therapeutic targets to alter the disease 
      pathology and treat the diseases. Several steps have been taken to identify the 
      early detection of the disease and drug repurposing for effective treatment of 
      NDDs. Moreover, it is logical that current medications are being evaluated for 
      their efficacy in treating such disorders; therefore, drug repurposing would be 
      an efficient, safe, and cost-effective way in finding out better medication. In 
      the current manuscript we discussed the utilization of drugs that have been 
      repurposed for the treatment of AD, PD, HD, MS, and ALS.

TI  - Harnessing endophenotypes and network medicine for Alzheimer's drug repurposing.
PG  - 2386-2426
LID - 10.1002/med.21709 [doi]
AB  - Following two decades of more than 400 clinical trials centered on the "one drug, 
      one target, one disease" paradigm, there is still no effective disease-modifying 
      therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inherent complexity of AD may challenge 
      this reductionist strategy. Recent observations and advances in network medicine 
      further indicate that AD likely shares common underlying mechanisms and 
      intermediate pathophenotypes, or endophenotypes, with other diseases. In this 
      review, we consider AD pathobiology, disease comorbidity, pleiotropy, and 
      therapeutic development, and construct relevant endophenotype networks to guide 
      future therapeutic development. Specifically, we discuss six main endophenotype 
      hypotheses in AD: amyloidosis, tauopathy, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial 
      dysfunction, vascular dysfunction, and lysosomal dysfunction. We further consider 
      how this endophenotype network framework can provide advances in computational 
      and experimental strategies for drug-repurposing and identification of new 
      candidate therapeutic strategies for patients suffering from or at risk for AD. 
      We highlight new opportunities for endophenotype-informed, drug discovery in AD, 
      by exploiting multi-omics data. Integration of genomics, transcriptomics, 
      radiomics, pharmacogenomics, and interactomics (protein-protein interactions) are 
      essential for successful drug discovery. We describe experimental technologies 
      for AD drug discovery including human induced pluripotent stem cells, transgenic 
      mouse/rat models, and population-based retrospective case-control studies that 
      may be integrated with multi-omics in a network medicine methodology. In summary, 
      endophenotype-based network medicine methodologies will promote AD therapeutic 
      development that will optimize the usefulness of available data and support deep 
      phenotyping of the patient heterogeneity for personalized medicine in AD.

TI  - Inhibition of Brain Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Activation: A Novel Target 
      in Neurodegenerative Diseases and Brain Injuries.
PG  - 13-22
LID - 10.1124/mol.120.119909 [doi]
AB  - Several reports have been published recently demonstrating a beneficial effect of 
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in improving pathologic and 
      behavioral conditions in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's 
      disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as well as the brain and spinal 
      cord injuries (SCI). Despite successful therapeutic effects of EGFR inhibition in 
      these pathologic conditions, there is still no report of proof-of-concept studies 
      in well-characterized animal models using recently developed blood-brain barrier 
      (BBB)-penetrating EGFR inhibitors, which is due to previous conflicting reports 
      concerning the level of EGFR or activated EGFR in normal and pathologic 
      conditions that caused target engagement to be a concern in any future EGFR 
      inhibition therapy. In this review, the level of EGFR expression and activation 
      in the developing central nervous system (CNS) compared with the adult CNS will 
      be explained as well as how neuronal injury or pathologic conditions, especially 
      inflammation and amyloid fibrils, induce reactive astrocytes leading to an 
      increase in the expression and activation of EGFR and, finally, 
      neurodegeneration. Furthermore, in this review, we will discuss two main 
      molecular mechanisms that can be proposed as the neuroprotective effects of EGFR 
      inhibition in these pathologic conditions. We will also review the recent 
      advances in the development of BBB-penetrating EGFR inhibitors in cancer therapy, 
      which may eventually be repositioned for NDDs and SCI therapy in the future. 
      SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Based on the lessons from the applications of EGFR 
      inhibitors in oncology, it is concluded that EGFR inhibitors can be beneficial in 
      treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injuries. They carry 
      their therapeutic potentials through induction of autophagy and attenuation of 
      reactive astrocytes.

      Perspectives to Clinical Trials.

AB  - Insulin resistance as a hallmark of type 2 DM (T2DM) plays a role in dementia by 
      promoting pathological lesions or enhancing the vulnerability of the brain. 
      Numerous studies related to insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) 
      signaling are linked with various types of dementia. Brain insulin resistance in 
      dementia is linked to disturbances in Aβ production and clearance, Tau 
      hyperphosphorylation, microglial activation causing increased neuroinflammation, 
      and the breakdown of tight junctions in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These 
      mechanisms have been studied primarily in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but research 
      on other forms of dementia like vascular dementia (VaD), Lewy body dementia 
      (LBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has also explored overlapping 
      mechanisms. Researchers are currently trying to repurpose anti-diabetic drugs to 
      treat dementia, which are dominated by insulin sensitizers and insulin 
      substrates. Although it seems promising and feasible, none of the trials have 
      succeeded in ameliorating cognitive decline in late-onset dementia. We highlight 
      the possibility of repositioning anti-diabetic drugs as a strategy for dementia 
      therapy by reflecting on current and previous clinical trials. We also describe 
      the molecular perspectives of various types of dementia through the insulin/IGF-1 
      signaling pathway.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is known to be a chronic disease, with an estimated 
      prevalence of about 10-30%, considering the population over 60 years of age. Most 
      patients with this disorder (> 95%) present the sporadic form, being 
      characterized by a late onset (80-90 years of age), and it is the consequence of 
      the failure to clear the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide from the interstices of the 
      brain. Significant numbers of genetic risk factors for the sporadic disease have 
      been researched. Some existing drugs for Alzheimer's disease provide symptomatic 
      benefit for up to 12 months, but there are no approved disease- modifying 
      therapies. In this line, a complementary strategy based on repositioning drugs 
      which are approved for the treatment of other disorders could be interesting. It 
      is noteworthy the fact that some clinical trials indicate that several classes of 
      drugs own potent and beneficial effects on the Alzheimer's disease treatment. In 
      this present work, we present the details and evaluation of these alternative 
      treatments. It has highlighted several compounds with relevant evidence for this 
      purpose, which deserves further investigation to clarify optimal treatment 
      conditions in the clinical trials of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multivariate and diversified disease and affects 
      the most sensitive areas of the brain, the cerebral cortex, and the hippocampus. 
      AD is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease most often associated 
      with memory deficits and cognition that get more worsen over time. The central 
      theory on the pathophysiological hallmark features of AD is characterized by the 
      accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, also associated with tau proteins (τ) 
      dysfunctioning which leads to distorted microtubular structure, affects the 
      cholinergic system, and mitochondrial biogenesis. This review emphasizes how 
      simple it is to find novel treatments for AD and focuses on several recently 
      developed medications through repurposing that can speed up traditional drug 
      development.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) remain uncharacterized. Here, we identify genes, molecular pathways and 
      cellular components associated with whole-brain dysregulation caused by 
      amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau deposits in the living human brain. We obtained in-vivo 
      resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), Aβ- and tau-PET for 47 cognitively 
      unimpaired and 16 AD participants from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and 
      Dementia cohort. Adverse neuronal activity impacts by Aβ and tau were quantified 
      with personalized dynamical models by fitting pathology-mediated computational 
      signals to the participant's real rs-fMRIs. Then, we detected robust brain-wide 
      associations between the spatial profiles of Aβ-tau impacts and gene expression 
      in the neurotypical transcriptome (Allen Human Brain Atlas). Within the obtained 
      distinctive signature of in-vivo neuronal dysfunction, several genes have 
      prominent roles in microglial activation and in interactions with Aβ and tau. 
      Moreover, cellular vulnerability estimations revealed strong association of 
      microglial expression patterns with Aβ and tau's synergistic impact on neuronal 
      activity (q < 0.001). These results further support the central role of the 
      immune system and neuroinflammatory pathways in AD pathogenesis. Neuronal 
      dysregulation by AD pathologies also associated with neurotypical synaptic and 
      developmental processes. In addition, we identified drug candidates from the vast 
      LINCS library to halt or reduce the observed Aβ-tau effects on neuronal activity. 
      Top-ranked pharmacological interventions target inflammatory, cancer and 
      cardiovascular pathways, including specific medications undergoing clinical 
      evaluation in AD. Our findings, based on the examination of 
      molecular-pathological-functional interactions in humans, may accelerate the 
      process of bringing effective therapies into clinical practice.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is pathologically 
      characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β plaques and the formation of 
      neurofibrillary tangles. In a neurodegenerative brain, glucose metabolism is also 
      impaired and considered as one of the key features in AD patients. The impairment 
      causes a reduction in glucose transporters and the uptake of glucose as well as 
      alterations in the specific activity of glycolytic enzymes. Recently, it has been 
      reported that α-amylase, a polysaccharide-degrading enzyme, is present in the 
      human brain. The enzyme is known to be associated with various diseases such as 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperamylasaemia. With this information at hand, we 
      hypothesize that α-amylase could have a vital role in the demented brains of AD 
      patients. This review aims to shed insight into the possible link between the 
      expression levels of α-amylase and AD. Lastly, we also cover the diverse role of 
      amylase inhibitors and how they could serve as a therapeutic agent to manage or 
      stop AD progression.

AB  - Drug repurposing is an effective method to reduce the time and cost of drug 
      development. Computational drug repurposing can quickly screen out the most 
      likely associations from large biological databases to achieve effective drug 
      repurposing. However, building a comprehensive model that integrates drugs, 
      proteins, and diseases for drug repurposing remains challenging. This study 
      proposes a drug repurposing method based on the ternary heterogeneous graph 
      attention network (DRTerHGAT). DRTerHGAT designs a novel protein feature 
      extraction process consisting of a large-scale protein language model and a 
      multi-task autoencoder, so that protein features can be extracted accurately and 
      efficiently from amino acid sequences. The ternary heterogeneous graph of 
      drug-protein-disease comprehensively considering the relationships among the 
      three types of nodes, including three homogeneous and three heterogeneous 
      relationships. Based on the graph and the extracted protein features, the deep 
      features of the drugs and the diseases are extracted by graph convolutional 
      networks (GCN) and heterogeneous graph node attention networks (HGNA). In the 
      experiments, DRTerHGAT is proven superior to existing advanced methods and 
      DRTerHGAT variants. DRTerHGAT's powerful ability for drug repurposing is also 
      demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Computational drug repurposing has the ability to remarkably reduce drug 
      development time and cost in an era where these factors are prohibitively high. 
      Several examples of successful repurposed drugs exist in fields such as oncology, 
      diabetes, leprosy, inflammatory bowel disease, among others, however 
      computational drug repurposing in neurodegenerative disease has presented several 
      unique challenges stemming from the lack of validation methods and difficulty in 
      studying heterogenous diseases of aging. Here, we examine existing approaches to 
      computational drug repurposing, including molecular, clinical, and biophysical 
      methods, and propose data sources and methods to advance computational drug 
      repurposing in neurodegenerative disease using Alzheimer's disease as an example.

PG  - 849-883
LID - 10.1080/13543776.2022.2083501 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are currently used as 
      antidepressants (selective MAO-A inhibitors) or as co-adjuvants for 
      neurodegenerative diseases (selective MAO-B inhibitors). The research within this 
      field is attracting attention due to their crucial role in the modulation of 
      brain functions, mood, and cognitive activity, and monoamine catabolism. AREAS 
      COVERED: MAO inhibitors (2018-2021) are discussed according to their chemotypes. 
      Structure-activity relationships are derived for each chemical scaffold 
      (propargylamines, chalcones, indoles, benzimidazoles, (iso)coumarins, 
      (iso)benzofurans, xanthones, and tetralones), while the chemical entities were 
      divided into newly synthesized molecules and natural metabolites. The mechanism 
      of action and type of inhibition are also considered. Lastly, new therapeutic 
      applications are reported, which demonstrates the clinical potential of these 
      inhibitors as well as the possibility of repurposing existing drugs for a variety 
      of diseases. EXPERT OPINION: MAO inhibitors here reported exhibit different 
      potencies and isoform selectivity. These compounds are clinically licensed for 
      multi-faceted neurodegenerative pathologies due to their ability to also act 
      against other relevant targets (cholinesterases, inflammation, and oxidative 
      stress). Moreover, the drug repurposing approach is an attractive strategy by 
      which MAO inhibitors may be applied for the treatment of prostate cancer, 
      inflammation, vertigo, and type 1 diabetes.

TI  - Mining on Alzheimer's diseases related knowledge graph to identity potential 
      AD-related semantic triples for drug repurposing.
PG  - 407

AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, there are no effective treatments for most neurodegenerative 
      diseases. Knowledge graphs can provide comprehensive and semantic representation 
      for heterogeneous data, and have been successfully leveraged in many biomedical 
      applications including drug repurposing. Our objective is to construct a 
      knowledge graph from literature to study the relations between Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) and chemicals, drugs and dietary supplements in order to identify 
      opportunities to prevent or delay neurodegenerative progression. We collected 
      biomedical annotations and extracted their relations using SemRep via SemMedDB. 
      We used both a BERT-based classifier and rule-based methods during data 
      preprocessing to exclude noise while preserving most AD-related semantic triples. 
      The 1,672,110 filtered triples were used to train with knowledge graph completion 
      algorithms (i.e., TransE, DistMult, and ComplEx) to predict candidates that might 
      be helpful for AD treatment or prevention. RESULTS: Among three knowledge graph 
      completion models, TransE outperformed the other two (MR = 10.53, Hits@1 = 0.28). 
      We leveraged the time-slicing technique to further evaluate the prediction 
      results. We found supporting evidence for most highly ranked candidates predicted 
      by our model which indicates that our approach can inform reliable new knowledge. 
      CONCLUSION: This paper shows that our graph mining model can predict reliable new 
      relationships between AD and other entities (i.e., dietary supplements, 
      chemicals, and drugs). The knowledge graph constructed can facilitate data-driven 
      knowledge discoveries and the generation of novel hypotheses.

TI  - Drug Repurposing in Oncology: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled 
      Clinical Trials.

AB  - Quality pharmacological treatment can improve survival in many types of cancer. 
      Drug repurposing offers advantages in comparison with traditional drug 
      development procedures, reducing time and risk. This systematic review identified 
      the most recent randomized controlled clinical trials that focus on drug 
      repurposing in oncology. We found that only a few clinical trials were 
      placebo-controlled or standard-of-care-alone-controlled. Metformin has been 
      studied for potential use in various types of cancer, including prostate, lung, 
      and pancreatic cancer. Other studies assessed the possible use of the 
      antiparasitic agent mebendazole in colorectal cancer and of propranolol in 
      multiple myeloma or, when combined with etodolac, in breast cancer. We were able 
      to identify trials that study the potential use of known antineoplastics in other 
      non-oncological conditions, such as imatinib for severe coronavirus disease in 
      2019 or a study protocol aiming to assess the possible repurposing of leuprolide 
      for Alzheimer's disease. Major limitations of these clinical trials were the 
      small sample size, the high clinical heterogeneity of the participants regarding 
      the stage of the neoplastic disease, and the lack of accounting for 
      multimorbidity and other baseline clinical characteristics. Drug repurposing 
      possibilities in oncology must be carefully examined with well-designed trials, 
      considering factors that could influence prognosis.

AB  - Drug repositioning or repurposing is the process of discovering leading-edge 
      indications for authorized or declined/abandoned molecules for use in different 
      diseases. This approach revitalizes the traditional drug discovery method by 
      revealing new therapeutic applications for existing drugs. There are numerous 
      studies available that highlight the triumph of several drugs as repurposed 
      therapeutics. For example, sildenafil to aspirin, thalidomide to adalimumab, and 
      so on. Millions of people worldwide are affected by neurodegenerative diseases. 
      According to a 2021 report, the Alzheimer's disease Association estimates that 
      6.2 million Americans are detected with Alzheimer's disease. By 2030, 
      approximately 1.2 million people in the United States possibly acquire 
      Parkinson's disease. Drugs that act on a single molecular target benefit people 
      suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. Current pharmacological approaches, on 
      the other hand, are constrained in their capacity to unquestionably alter the 
      course of the disease and provide patients with inadequate and momentary 
      benefits. Drug repositioning-based approaches appear to be very pertinent, 
      expense- and time-reducing strategies for the enhancement of medicinal 
      opportunities for such diseases in the current era. Kinase inhibitors, for 
      example, which were developed for various oncology indications, demonstrated 
      significant neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases. This review 
      expounds on the classical and recent examples of drug repositioning at various 
      stages of drug development, with a special focus on neurodegenerative disorders 
      and the aspects of threats and issues viz. the regulatory, scientific, and 
      economic aspects.

TI  - Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers Rescue 
      Memory Defects in Drosophila-Expressing Alzheimer's Disease-Related Transgenes 
      Independently of the Canonical Renin Angiotensin System.
LID - ENEURO.0235-20.2020 [pii]
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0235-20.2020 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder that causes progressive 
      memory and cognitive decline. Recently, studies have reported that inhibitors of 
      the mammalian renin angiotensin system (RAS) result in a significant reduction in 
      the incidence and progression of AD by unknown mechanisms. Here, we used a 
      genetic and pharmacological approach to evaluate the beneficial effects of 
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor 
      blockers (ARBs) in Drosophila expressing AD-related transgenes. Importantly, 
      while ACE orthologs have been identified in Drosophila, other RAS components are 
      not conserved. We show that captopril, an ACE-I, and losartan, an ARB, can 
      suppress a rough eye phenotype and brain cell death in flies expressing a mutant 
      human C99 transgene. Captopril also significantly rescues memory defects in these 
      flies. Similarly, both drugs reduce cell death in Drosophila expressing human 
      Aβ42 and losartan significantly rescues memory deficits. However, neither drug 
      affects production, accumulation or clearance of Aβ42 Importantly, neither drug 
      rescued brain cell death in Drosophila expressing human Tau, suggesting that RAS 
      inhibitors specifically target the amyloid pathway. Of note, we also observed 
      reduced cell death and a complete rescue of memory deficits when we crossed a 
      null mutation in Drosophila Acer into each transgenic line demonstrating that the 
      target of captopril in Drosophila is Acer. Together, these studies demonstrate 
      that captopril and losartan are able to modulate AD related phenotypes in the 
      absence of the canonical RAS pathway and suggest that both drugs have additional 
      targets that can be identified in Drosophila.

TI  - Neuropathological stage-dependent proteome mapping of the olfactory tract in 
      Alzheimer's disease: From early olfactory-related omics signatures to 
      computational repurposing of drug candidates.
PG  - e13252
LID - 10.1111/bpa.13252 [doi]
LID - e13252
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by an 
      early olfactory dysfunction, progressive memory loss, and behavioral 
      deterioration. Albeit substantial progress has been made in characterizing 
      AD-associated molecular and cellular events, there is an unmet clinical need for 
      new therapies. In this study, olfactory tract proteotyping performed in controls 
      and AD subjects (n = 17/group) showed a Braak stage-dependent proteostatic 
      impairment accompanied by the progressive modulation of amyloid precursor protein 
      and tau functional interactomes. To implement a computational repurposing of drug 
      candidates with the capacity to reverse early AD-related olfactory omics 
      signatures (OMSs), we generated a consensual OMSs database compiling differential 
      omics datasets obtained by mass-spectrometry or RNA-sequencing derived from 
      initial AD across the olfactory axis. Using the Connectivity Map-based drug 
      repurposing approach, PKC, EGFR, Aurora kinase, Glycogen synthase kinase, and CDK 
      inhibitors were the top pharmacologic classes capable to restore multiple OMSs, 
      whereas compounds with targeted activity to inhibit PI3K, Insulin-like growth 
      factor 1 (IGF-1), microtubules, and Polo-like kinase (PLK) represented a family 
      of drugs with detrimental potential to induce olfactory AD-associated gene 
      expression changes. To validate the potential therapeutic effects of the proposed 
      drugs, in vitro assays were performed. These validation experiments revealed that 
      pretreatment of human neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells with the EGFR inhibitor AG-1478 
      showed a neuroprotective effect against hydrogen peroxide-induced damage while 
      the pretreatment with the Aurora kinase inhibitor Reversine reduced amyloid-beta 
      (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity. Taken together, our data pointed out that OMSs may be 
      useful as substrates for drug repurposing to propose novel neuroprotective 
      treatments against AD.

      Link Prediction on Biomedical Literature.

AB  - Recently, computational drug repurposing has emerged as a promising method for 
      identifying new pharmaceutical interventions (PI) for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). 
      Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as Vitamin E and Music therapy, have 
      great potential to improve cognitive function and slow the progression of AD, but 
      have largely been unexplored. This study predicts novel NPIs for AD through link 
      prediction on our developed biomedical knowledge graph. We constructed a 
      comprehensive knowledge graph containing AD concepts and various potential 
      interventions, called ADInt, by integrating a dietary supplement domain knowledge 
      graph, SuppKG, with semantic relations from SemMedDB database. Four knowledge 
      graph embedding models (TransE, RotatE, DistMult and ComplEX) and two graph 
      convolutional network models (R-GCN and CompGCN) were compared to learn the 
      representation of ADInt. R-GCN outperformed other models by evaluating on the 
      time slice test set and the clinical trial test set and was used to generate the 
      score tables of the link prediction task. Discovery patterns were applied to 
      generate mechanism pathways for high scoring triples. Our ADInt had 162,213 nodes 
      and 1,017,319 edges. The graph convolutional network model, R-GCN, performed best 
      in both the Time Slicing test set (MR = 7.099, MRR = 0.5007, Hits@1 = 0.4112, 
      Hits@3 = 0.5058, Hits@10 = 0.6804) and the Clinical Trials test set (MR = 1.731, 
      MRR = 0.8582, Hits@1 = 0.7906, Hits@3 = 0.9033, Hits@10 = 0.9848). Among high 
      scoring triples in the link prediction results, we found the plausible mechanism 
      pathways of (Photodynamic therapy, PREVENTS, Alzheimer's Disease) and 
      (Choerospondias axillaris, PREVENTS, Alzheimer's Disease) by discovery patterns 
      and discussed them further. In conclusion, we presented a novel methodology to 
      extend an existing knowledge graph and discover NPIs (dietary supplements (DS) 
      and complementary and integrative health (CIH)) for AD. We used discovery 
      patterns to find mechanisms for predicted triples to solve the poor 
      interpretability of artificial neural networks. Our method can potentially be 
      applied to other clinical problems, such as discovering drug adverse reactions 
      and drug-drug interactions.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a devastating neurodegenerative disease with few 
      preventive or curative treatments available. Modern technology developments of 
      high-throughput omics platforms and imaging equipment provide unprecedented 
      opportunities to study the etiology and progression of this disease. Meanwhile, 
      the vast amount of data from various modalities, such as genetics, proteomics, 
      transcriptomics, and imaging, as well as clinical features impose great 
      challenges in data integration and analysis. Machine learning (ML) methods offer 
      novel techniques to address high dimensional data, integrate data from different 
      sources, model the etiological and clinical heterogeneity, and discover new 
      biomarkers. These directions have the potential to help us better manage the 
      disease progression and develop novel treatment strategies. This mini-review 
      paper summarizes different ML methods that have been applied to study AD using 
      single-platform or multi-modal data. We review the current state of ML 
      applications for five key directions of AD research: disease classification, drug 
      repurposing, subtyping, progression prediction, and biomarker discovery. This 
      summary provides insights about the current research status of ML-based AD 
      research and highlights potential directions for future research.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), a most prevailing neurodegenerative disorder with 
      turbulence in cognitive and behavioural abilities, epitomizes one of the highest 
      unmet medical requirements. The current AD treatment focuses merely on 
      symptomatic relief, this explains a dearth in drug research oriented towards 
      unwinding of disease specific druggable targets. On the other hand, toxicity and 
      poor bioavailability hamper the evolution of novel chemical entities (NCE) in 
      clinical trials. Drug repurposing offers a gateway to rejuvenate new therapeutic 
      applications for existing approved drugs. This study concentrates on the 
      identification of potential druggable AD targets and screening of FDA approved 
      drugs with a concept of drug repurposing. differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
      were identified in frontal cortex, temporal cortex and hippocampus in AD patients 
      from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE36980. Protein-protein interaction 
      (PPI) analysis revealed SERPINA3 and BDNF to possess high node degree interaction 
      with literature derived candidate genes (LDGs) in AD males and females, 
      respectively, thus were selected as potential AD targets. Subsequently, FDA 
      approved drugs were screened through the above shortlisted targets and were 
      ranked based on molecular docking and MM-GBSA energy calculations using Glide and 
      Prime tools, respectively. Drugs possessing best docking score and maximum 
      binding energy were further evaluated through molecular dynamics simulation 
      studies, which revealed the affinity of Tiludronic acid and Olsalazine towards 
      SERPINA3 and BDNF, respectively.

PG  - 647-654

AB  - BACKGROUND: β-amyloid (Aβ) production and aggregation are the main culprits of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is no treatment available for halting the disease 
      progression. Antibiotics are used not only to treat infections but also to some 
      of the non-contagious diseases and have found active as anti-amyloidogenic 
      agents. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to investigate anti-amyloidogenic 
      activity of antibiotics as repurposing agents via inhibiting Aβ aggregation and 
      fibril formation employing in silico and in vitro approaches. METHODS: In silico 
      screening was designed with receptor and ligand preparation, grid formation, 
      docking simulation and its analysis. Thioflavin T-amyloid binding and 
      protease-digestion studies were intended as in vitro assays. These methods 
      assessed the pharmacological potential of antibiotics as anti-amyloidogenic 
      agents. RESULTS: Paromomycin and Neomycin were identified with a higher order of 
      estimated free energy of binding in in silico experiments. In in vitro screening, 
      paromomycin significantly (p<0.01) reduced the fluorescence intensity and 
      resistance to tryptic degradation of Aβ(1-42) peptides while neomycin had no or 
      little effect (p<0.01) when compared to control. Results from docking and wet lab 
      studies were found in correlation. CONCLUSION: Paromomycin exhibited higher 
      anti-Aβ aggregating and defibrillogenic activity than neomycin and left an 
      indication for further in vivo testing and could be a future promising 
      antiamyloidal candidate for the treatment of several amyloidoses.

      the interplay of COVID, Alzheimer's, and diabetes.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has greatly affected global 
      health. Emerging evidence suggests a complex interplay between Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), diabetes (DM), and COVID-19. Given COVID-19's involvement in the 
      increased risk of other diseases, there is an urgent need to identify novel 
      targets and drugs to combat these interconnected health challenges. 
      Lysophosphatidic acid receptors (LPARs), belonging to the G protein-coupled 
      receptor family, have been implicated in various pathological conditions, 
      including inflammation. In this regard, the study aimed to investigate the 
      involvement of LPARs (specifically LPAR1, 3, 6) in the tri-directional 
      relationship between AD, DM, and COVID-19 through network analysis, as well as 
      explore the therapeutic potential of selected anti-AD, anti-DM drugs as LPAR, 
      SPIKE antagonists. We used the Coremine Medical database to identify genes 
      related to DM, AD, and COVID-19. Furthermore, STRING analysis was used to 
      identify the interacting partners of LPAR1, LPAR3, and LPAR6. Additionally, a 
      literature search revealed 78 drugs on the market or in clinical studies that 
      were used for treating either AD or DM. We carried out docking analysis of these 
      drugs against the LPAR1, LPAR3, and LPAR6. Furthermore, we modeled the LPAR1, 
      LPAR3, and LPAR6 in a complex with the COVID-19 spike protein and performed a 
      docking study of selected drugs with the LPAR-Spike complex. The analysis 
      revealed 177 common genes implicated in AD, DM, and COVID-19. Protein-protein 
      docking analysis demonstrated that LPAR (1,3 & 6) efficiently binds with the 
      viral SPIKE protein, suggesting them as targets for viral infection. Furthermore, 
      docking analysis of the anti-AD and anti-DM drugs against LPARs, SPIKE protein, 
      and the LPARs-SPIKE complex revealed promising candidates, including lupron, 
      neflamapimod, and nilotinib, stating the importance of drug repurposing in the 
      drug discovery process. These drugs exhibited the ability to bind and inhibit the 
      LPAR receptor activity and the SPIKE protein and interfere with LPAR-SPIKE 
      protein interaction. Through a combined network and targeted-based therapeutic 
      intervention approach, this study has identified several drugs that could be 
      repurposed for treating COVID-19 due to their expected interference with LPAR(1, 
      3, and 6) and spike protein complexes. In addition, it can also be hypothesized 
      that the co-administration of these identified drugs during COVID-19 infection 
      may not only help mitigate the impact of the virus but also potentially 
      contribute to the prevention or management of post-COVID complications related to 
      AD and DM.

TI  - Repurposing ibudilast to mitigate Alzheimer's disease by targeting inflammation.
PG  - 898-911
LID - 10.1093/brain/awac136 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial disease that exhibits cognitive deficits, 
      neuronal loss, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuroinflammation in 
      the brain. Hence, a multi-target drug would improve treatment efficacy. We 
      applied a new multi-scale predictive modelling framework that integrates machine 
      learning with biophysics and systems pharmacology to screen drugs for Alzheimer's 
      disease using patients' tissue samples. Our predictive modelling framework 
      identified ibudilast as a drug with repurposing potential to treat Alzheimer's 
      disease. Ibudilast is a multi-target drug, as it is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor 
      and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist. In addition, we predict that 
      ibudilast inhibits off-target kinases (e.g. IRAK1 and GSG2). In Japan and other 
      Asian countries, ibudilast is approved for treating asthma and stroke due to its 
      anti-inflammatory potential. Based on these previous studies and on our 
      predictions, we tested for the first time the efficacy of ibudilast in Fisher 
      transgenic 344-AD rats. This transgenic rat model is unique as it exhibits 
      hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory deficits and Alzheimer's 
      disease pathology, including hippocampal amyloid plaques, tau paired-helical 
      filaments, neuronal loss and microgliosis, in a progressive age-dependent manner 
      that mimics the pathology observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. Following 
      long-term treatment with ibudilast, transgenic rats were evaluated at 11 months 
      of age for spatial memory performance and Alzheimer's disease pathology. We 
      demonstrate that ibudilast-treatment of transgenic rats mitigated 
      hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficits, as well as hippocampal (hilar 
      subregion) amyloid plaque and tau paired-helical filament load, and microgliosis 
      compared to untreated transgenic rat. Neuronal density analysed across all 
      hippocampal regions was similar in ibudilast-treated transgenic compared to 
      untreated transgenic rats. Interestingly, RNA sequencing analysis of hippocampal 
      tissue showed that ibudilast-treatment affects gene expression levels of the TLR 
      and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways differentially in male and female transgenic 
      rats. Based on the TLR4 signalling pathway, our RNA sequencing data suggest that 
      ibudilast-treatment inhibits IRAK1 activity by increasing expression of its 
      negative regulator IRAK3, and/or by altering TRAF6 and other TLR-related 
      ubiquitin ligase and conjugase levels. Our results support that ibudilast can 
      serve as a repurposed drug that targets multiple pathways including TLR 
      signalling and the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway to reduce cognitive deficits and 
      pathology relevant to Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The abundance of biomedical knowledge gained from biological experiments and 
      clinical practices is an invaluable resource for biomedicine. The emerging 
      biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) provide an efficient and effective way to 
      manage the abundant knowledge in biomedical and life science. In this study, we 
      created a comprehensive BKG called the integrative Biomedical Knowledge Hub 
      (iBKH) by harmonizing and integrating information from diverse biomedical 
      resources. To make iBKH easily accessible for biomedical research, we developed a 
      web-based, user-friendly graphical portal that allows fast and interactive 
      knowledge retrieval. Additionally, we also implemented an efficient and scalable 
      graph learning pipeline for discovering novel biomedical knowledge in iBKH. As a 
      proof of concept, we performed our iBKH-based method for computational in-silico 
      drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease. The iBKH is publicly available.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are 
      characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal cells, resulting in different 
      clinical symptoms according to the affected brain region. Although there are 
      drugs available for the treatment of these diseases, they present relatively low 
      efficacy and are not capable of modifying the course of the disease or stopping 
      its progression. In the field of drug development, drug repurposing could be an 
      interesting strategy to search new therapeutic options against neurodegenerative 
      diseases, since it involves lower costs and time for development. In this review, 
      we discuss the search of new treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease 
      through drug repurposing. A focus was given to drugs that modulate 
      neuroinflammation, since it represents a common point among neurodegenerative 
      diseases and has been explored as a target for drug action.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are often age-related disorders that can cause 
      dementia in people, usually over 65 years old, are still lacking effective 
      therapies. Some NDs have recently been linked to toxic protein aggregates, for 
      example Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      and Huntington disease; therefore, mulating toxic protein aggregates would be a 
      promising therapeutic strategy. Moreover, drug repurposing, in other words 
      exploiting drugs that are already in use for another indication, has been 
      attracting mounting attention for potential therapeutic purposes in NDs. Thus, in 
      this review, we focus on summarizing a series of repurposed small-molecule drugs 
      for eliminating or inhibiting toxic protein aggregates and further discuss their 
      intricate molecular mechanisms to improve the current ND treatment. Taken 
      together, these findings will shed new light on exploiting more repurposed 
      small-molecule drugs targeting different types of toxic proteins to fight NDs in 
      the future.

AB  - Medical and scientific communities have been striving to disentangle the 
      complexity of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      and Parkinson's disease (PD), in order to develop a cure or effective treatment 
      for these diseases. Along this journey, it has become important to identify the 
      early events occurring in the prodromal phases of these diseases and the 
      disorders that increase the risk of neurodegeneration highlighting common 
      pathological features. This strategy has led to a wealth of evidence identifying 
      diabetes, mainly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a main risk factor for the 
      onset and progression of AD and PD. Impaired glucose metabolism, insulin 
      resistance, and mitochondrial dysfunction are features common to both type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and AD and PD, and they appear before clinical 
      diagnosis of the two neurodegenerative diseases. These could represent the 
      strategic nodes of therapeutic intervention. Following this line of thought, a 
      conceivable approach is to repurpose antidiabetic drugs as valuable agents that 
      may prevent or reduce the risk of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. This 
      review summarizes the past and current findings that link AD and PD with T2DM, 
      emphasizing the common pathological mechanisms. The efficacy of antidiabetic 
      drugs, namely intranasal insulin, metformin, and thiazolidinediones, in the 
      prevention and/or treatment of AD and PD is also discussed.

AB  - Ceftriaxone (CEF) is a safe and multipotent antimicrobial agent that possesses 
      neuroprotective properties. Earlier, we revealed the restoration of cognitive 
      function in OXYS rats with signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology by 
      CEF along with its modulating the expression of genes related to the system of 
      amyloid beta (Aβ) metabolism in the brain. The aim of this study was to determine 
      the effects of CEF on behavior, Aβ deposition, and associated neuroinflammation 
      using another model of an early AD-like pathology induced by Aβ. Mice were 
      injected bilaterally i.c.v. with Aβ fragment 25-35 to produce the AD model, while 
      the CEF treatment (100 mg/kg/day, i.p., 36 days) started the next day after the 
      surgery. The open field test, T-maze, Barnes test, IntelliCage, and passive 
      avoidance test were used for behavioral phenotyping. Neuronal density, amyloid 
      accumulation, and the expression of neuroinflammatory markers were measured in 
      the frontal cortex and hippocampus. CEF exhibited beneficial effects on some 
      cognitive features impaired by Aβ neurotoxicity including complete restoration of 
      the fear-induced memory and learning in the passive avoidance test and improved 
      place learning in the IntelliCage. CEF significantly attenuated amyloid 
      deposition and neuroinflammatory response. Thus, CEF could be positioned as a 
      potent multipurpose drug as it simultaneously targets proteostasis network and 
      neuroinflammation, as well as glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative pathways, and 
      neurotrophic function as reported earlier. Together with previous reports on the 
      positive effects of CEF in AD models, the results confirm the potential of CEF as 
      a promising treatment against cognitive decline from the early stages of AD 
      progression.

TI  - Methotrexate for Drug Repurposing as an Anti-Aggregatory Agent to Mercuric 
      Treated α-Chymotrypsinogen-A.
PG  - 362-374
LID - 10.1007/s10930-024-10187-z [doi]
AB  - Protein aggregation is related to numerous pathological conditions like 
      Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In our study, we have shown that an already 
      existing FDA-approved drug; methotrexate (MTX) can be reprofiled on preformed 
      α-chymotrypsinogen A (α-Cgn A) aggregates. The zymogen showed formation of 
      aggregates upon interaction with mercuric ions, with increasing concentration of 
      Hg(2)Cl(2) (0-150 µM). The hike in ThT and ANS fluorescence concomitant with blue 
      shift, bathochromic shift and the hyperchromic effect in the CR absorbance, RLS 
      and turbidity measurements, substantiate the zymogen β-rich aggregate formation. 
      The secondary structural alterations of α- Cgn A as analyzed by CD measurements, 
      FTIR and Raman spectra showed the transformation of native β-barrel conformation 
      to β-inter-molecular rich aggregates. The native α- Cgn A have about 30% 
      α-helical content which was found to be about 3% in presence of mercuric ions 
      suggesting the formation of aggregates. The amorphous aggregates were visualized 
      by SEM. On incubation of Hg(2)Cl(2) treated α- Cgn A with increasing 
      concentration of the MTX resulted in reversing aggregates to the native-like 
      structure. These results were supported by remarkable decrease in ThT and ANS 
      fluorescence intensities and CR absorbance and also consistent with CD, FTIR, and 
      Raman spectroscopy data. MTX was found to increase the α-helical content of the 
      zymogen from 3 to 15% proposing that drug is efficient in disrupting the 
      β-inter-molecular rich aggregates and reverting it to native like structure. The 
      SEM images are in accordance with CD data showing the disintegration of 
      aggregates. The most effective concentration of the drug was found to be 120 µM. 
      Molecular docking analysis showed that MTX molecule was surrounded by the 
      hydrophobic residues including Phe39, His40, Arg145, Tyr146, Thr151, Gly193, 
      Ser195, and Gly216 and conventional hydrogen bonds, including Gln73 (bond length: 
      2.67Å), Gly142 (2.59Å), Thr144 (2.81Å), Asn150 (2.73Å), Asp153 (2.71Å), and 
      Cys191 (2.53Å). This investigation will help to find the use of already existing 
      drugs to cure protein misfolding-related abnormalities.

AB  - The heterogeneity and complex nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is attributed to 
      several genetic risk factors and molecular culprits. The slow pace and increasing 
      failure rate of conventional drug discovery has led to the exploration of 
      complementary strategies based on repurposing approved drugs to treat AD. Drug 
      repurposing (DR) is a cost-effective, low-risk, and efficient approach for 
      identifying novel therapeutic candidates for AD treatment. Similarly, hybrid drug 
      design through the integration of distinct pharmacophores from known or failed 
      drugs and natural products is an interesting strategy to target the 
      multifactorial nature of AD. In this Perspective, we discuss the potential of DR 
      and highlight promising drug candidates that can be advanced for clinical trials, 
      backed by a detailed discussion on their plausible mechanisms of action. Our 
      article fosters research on the hidden potential of DR and hybrid drug design 
      with the goal of unravelling new drugs and targets to tackle AD.

AB  - Clinical trials have extensively failed to find effective treatments for 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) so far. Even after decades of AD research, there are 
      still limited options for treating dementia. Mounting evidence has indicated that 
      AD patients develop central and peripheral metabolic dysfunction, and the 
      underpinnings of such events have recently begun to emerge. Basic and preclinical 
      studies have unveiled key pathophysiological mechanisms that include aberrant 
      brain stress signaling, inflammation, and impaired insulin sensitivity. These 
      findings are in accordance with clinical and neuropathological data suggesting 
      that AD patients undergo central and peripheral metabolic deregulation. Here, we 
      review recent basic and clinical findings indicating that metabolic defects are 
      central to AD pathophysiology. We further propose a view for future therapeutics 
      that incorporates metabolic defects as a core feature of AD pathogenesis. This 
      approach could improve disease understanding and therapy development through drug 
      repurposing and/or identification of novel metabolic targets.

AB  - Numerous clinical trials of drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have 
      failed, and computational drug repositioning approaches using omics data have 
      been proposed as effective alternative approaches to the discovery of drug 
      candidates. However, little multi-omics data is available for AD, due to limited 
      availability of brain tissues. Even if omics data exist, systematic drug 
      repurposing study for AD has suffered from lack of big data, insufficient 
      clinical information, and difficulty in data integration on account of sample 
      heterogeneity derived from poor diagnosis or shortage of qualified post-mortem 
      tissue. In this study, we developed a proteotranscriptomic-based computational 
      drug repositioning method named Drug Repositioning Perturbation Score/Class 
      (DRPS/C) based on inverse associations between disease- and drug-induced gene and 
      protein perturbation patterns, incorporating pharmacogenomic knowledge. We 
      constructed a Drug-induced Gene Perturbation Signature Database (DGPSD) comprised 
      of 61,019 gene signatures perturbed by 1,520 drugs from the Connectivity Map 
      (CMap) and the L1000 CMap. Drugs were classified into three DRPCs (High, 
      Intermediate, and Low) according to DRPSs that were calculated using drug- and 
      disease-induced gene perturbation signatures from DGPSD and The Cancer Genome 
      Atlas (TCGA), respectively. The DRPS/C method was evaluated using the area under 
      the ROC curve, with a prescribed drug list from TCGA as the gold standard. 
      Glioblastoma had the highest AUC. To predict anti-AD drugs, DRPS were calculated 
      using DGPSD and AD-induced gene/protein perturbation signatures generated from 
      RNA-seq, microarray and proteomic datasets in the Synapse database, and the drugs 
      were classified into DRPCs. We predicted 31 potential anti-AD drug candidates 
      commonly belonged to high DRPCs of transcriptomic and proteomic signatures. Of 
      these, four drugs classified into the nervous system group of Anatomical 
      Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) system are voltage-gated sodium channel blockers 
      (bupivacaine, topiramate) and monamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, 
      iproniazid), and their mechanism of action was inferred from a potential anti-AD 
      drug perspective. Our approach suggests a shortcut to discover new efficacy of 
      drugs for AD.

TI  - The Potential of a Stratified Approach to Drug Repurposing in Alzheimer's 
      Disease.
LID - 10.3390/biom14010011 [doi]
LID - 11
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition that is 
      characterized by the build-up of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary 
      tangles. While multiple theories explaining the aetiology of the disease have 
      been suggested, the underlying cause of the disease is still unknown. Despite 
      this, several modifiable and non-modifiable factors that increase the risk of 
      developing AD have been identified. To date, only eight AD drugs have ever gained 
      regulatory approval, including six symptomatic and two disease-modifying drugs. 
      However, not all are available in all countries and high costs associated with 
      new disease-modifying biologics prevent large proportions of the patient 
      population from accessing them. With the current patient population expected to 
      triple by 2050, it is imperative that new, effective, and affordable drugs become 
      available to patients. Traditional drug development strategies have a 99% failure 
      rate in AD, which is far higher than in other disease areas. Even when a drug 
      does reach the market, additional barriers such as high cost and lack of 
      accessibility prevent patients from benefiting from them. In this review, we 
      discuss how a stratified medicine drug repurposing approach may address some of 
      the limitations and barriers that traditional strategies face in relation to drug 
      development in AD. We believe that novel, stratified drug repurposing studies may 
      expedite the discovery of alternative, effective, and more affordable treatment 
      options for a rapidly expanding patient population in comparison with traditional 
      drug development methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human diseases are multi-factorial biological phenomena resulting 
      from perturbations of numerous functional networks. The complex nature of human 
      diseases explains frequently observed marginal or transitory efficacy of 
      mono-therapeutic interventions. For this reason, combination therapy is being 
      increasingly evaluated as a biologically plausible strategy for reversing disease 
      state, fostering the development of dedicated methodological and experimental 
      approaches. In parallel, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a 
      prominent opportunity for disclosing human-specific therapeutic targets and 
      rational drug repurposing. OBJECTIVE: In this context, our objective was to 
      elaborate an integrated computational platform to accelerate discovery and 
      experimental validation of synergistic combinations of repurposed drugs for 
      treatment of common human diseases. METHODS: The proposed approach combines 
      adapted statistical analysis of GWAS data, pathway-based functional annotation of 
      genetic findings using gene set enrichment technique, computational 
      reconstruction of signaling networks enriched in disease-associated genes, 
      selection of candidate repurposed drugs and proof-of-concept combinational 
      experimental screening. RESULTS: It enables robust identification of signaling 
      pathways enriched in disease susceptibility loci. Therapeutic targeting of the 
      disease-associated signaling networks provides a reliable way for rational drug 
      repurposing and rapid development of synergistic drug combinations for common 
      human diseases. CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of 
      the proposed approach with an experiment application to Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Metformin, a primary anti-diabetic medication, has been anticipated to provide 
      benefits for Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known as "type 3 diabetes". 
      Nevertheless, some studies have demonstrated that metformin may trigger AD 
      pathology and even elevate AD risk in humans. Despite this, limited research has 
      elucidated the behavioral outcomes of metformin treatment, which would hold 
      significant translational value. Thus, we aimed to perform thorough behavioral 
      research on the prolonged administration of metformin to mice: We administered 
      metformin (300 mg/kg/day) to transgenic 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic (NT) C57BL/6 
      mice over 1 and 2 years, respectively, and evaluated their behaviors across 
      multiple domains via touchscreen operant chambers, including motivation, 
      attention, memory, visual discrimination, and cognitive flexibility. We found 
      metformin enhanced attention, inhibitory control, and associative learning in 
      younger NT mice (≤16 months). However, chronic treatment led to impairments in 
      memory retention and discrimination learning at older age. Furthermore, metformin 
      caused learning and memory impairment and increased levels of AMPKα1-subunit, 
      β-amyloid oligomers, plaques, phosphorylated tau, and GSK3β expression in AD 
      mice. No changes in potential confounding factors on cognition, including levels 
      of motivation, locomotion, appetite, body weight, blood glucose, and serum 
      vitamin B12, were observed in metformin-treated AD mice. We also identified an 
      enhanced amyloidogenic pathway in db/db mice, as well as in Neuro2a-APP(695) 
      cells and a decrease in synaptic markers, such as PSD-95 and synaptophysin in 
      primary neurons, upon metformin treatment. Our findings collectively suggest that 
      the repurposing of metformin should be carefully reconsidered when this drug is 
      used for individuals with AD.

AB  - Fyn kinase is a member of the Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase family. Fyn is 
      involved in multiple signaling pathways extending from cell proliferation and 
      differentiation to cell adhesion and cell motility, and it has been found to be 
      overexpressed in various types of cancers. In the central nervous system, Fyn 
      exerts several different functions such as axon-glial signal transduction, 
      oligodendrocyte maturation, and myelination, and it is implicated in 
      neuroinflammatory processes. Based on these premises, Fyn emerges as an 
      attractive target in cancer and neurodegenerative disease therapy, particularly 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), based on its activation by Aβ via cellular prion 
      protein and its interaction with tau protein. However, Fyn is also a challenging 
      target since the Fyn inhibitors discovered so far, due to the relevant homology 
      of Fyn with other kinases, suffer from off-target effects. This review covers the 
      efforts performed in the last decade to identify and optimize small molecules 
      that effectively inhibit Fyn, both in enzymatic and in cell assays, including 
      drug repositioning practices, as an opportunity for therapeutic intervention in 
      neurodegeneration.

AB  - Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an international health research priority 
      for our aging population, little therapeutic progress has been made. This lack of 
      progress may be partially attributable to disease heterogeneity. Previous studies 
      have identified an inverse association of cancer and AD, suggesting that cancer 
      history may be one source of AD heterogeneity. These findings are particularly 
      interesting in light of the number of common risk factors and two-hit models 
      hypothesized to commonly drive both diseases. We reviewed the ten hallmark 
      biological alterations of cancer cells to investigate overlap with the AD 
      literature and identified overlap of all ten hallmarks in AD, including (1) 
      potentially common underlying risk factors, such as increased inflammation, 
      deregulated cellular energetics, and genome instability; (2) inversely regulated 
      mechanisms, including cell death and evading growth suppressors; and (3) 
      functions with more complex, pleiotropic mechanisms, some of which may be 
      stage-dependent in AD, such as cell adhesion/contact inhibition and angiogenesis. 
      Additionally, we discuss the recent observation of a biological link between 
      cancer and AD neuropathology. Finally, we address the therapeutic implications of 
      this topic. The significant overlap of functional pathways and molecules between 
      these diseases, some similarly and some oppositely regulated or functioning in 
      each disease, supports the need for more research to elucidate cancer-related AD 
      genetic and functional heterogeneity, with the aims of better understanding AD 
      risk mediators, as well as further exploring the potential for some types of drug 
      repurposing towards AD therapeutic development.

PG  - 603-609
LID - 10.1080/13543784.2021.1916913 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by the toxic 
      accumulation of α-synuclein protein inside neural cells; this results in 
      neurodegeneration which is clinically accompanied by behavioral and psychological 
      changes. DLB shares features with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Parkinson's 
      disease dementia (PDD), but also overlaps neurochemically and pathologically with 
      Alzheimer's disease. Symptomatic treatments for LBD differ in their effectiveness 
      while disease-modifying and curative approaches are much needed.Areas covered: We 
      explore emerging therapeutics for DLB through the lens of repurposing approved 
      drugs and survey their potential for disease modifying actions in DLB. Given the 
      complexity of DLB with multiple pathologies, potential therapeutic targets that 
      could affect Lewy body pathology, or metabolism or neurotransmitters or 
      immunomodulation were surveyed. We queried PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov searches 
      2017-2020.Expert opinion: DLB is not simply aredux ofAD or PD; hence, treatments 
      should not be exclusively duplicative ofAD or PD directed treatments. This opens 
      amyriad of possibilities for therapeutic approaches that are disease specific or 
      repurposed.

PG  - 683-695
LID - 10.1080/14737175.2017.1326818 [doi]
AB  - The number of people with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, is growing as 
      a result of an ageing global population. Treatments available for AD only 
      alleviate the symptoms of the disease, and are effective in some people with AD 
      for a limited time. There is no disease-modifying treatment available, and 
      despite research efforts, the underlying mechanisms of AD and optimal treatment 
      targets have not been fully elucidated. Amyloid and tau are key pathological 
      markers of AD with ongoing trials targeting both. However, there are also many 
      trials at various stages of development that primarily target other markers and 
      processes implicated in the disease, which are now being investigated. Areas 
      covered: This review summarizes current treatment approaches for AD and explores 
      both repositioned and novel therapies that target non amyloid and non tau 
      mechanisms that are in the clinical trials pipeline. This includes treatments for 
      cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms and potentially disease modifying 
      therapies. The studies included in this review have been obtained from searches 
      of PubMed and clinical trials databases. Expert commentary: There is a renewed 
      energy in identifying better treatments for behavioural symptoms of AD using both 
      novel drugs and repositioning existing drugs. Lack of success in clinical trials 
      of drugs targeting amyloid and tau have led to a surge in targeting alternative 
      mechanisms. Progress in the development of biomarkers will provide further tools 
      for clinical trials of potential therapeutics for both symptomatic treatment and 
      disease modification in AD.

AB  - Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the deposition of 
      abnormal tau in the brain. To date, there are no disease-modifying therapies 
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the treatment of 
      tauopathies. In the past decades, extensive efforts have been provided to develop 
      disease-modifying therapies to treat tauopathies. Specifically, exploring 
      existing drugs with the intent of repurposing for the treatment of tauopathies 
      affords a reasonable alternative to discover potent drugs for treating these 
      formidable diseases. Drug repurposing will not only reduce formulation and 
      development stage effort and cost but will also take a key advantage of the 
      established toxicological studies, which is one of the main causes of clinical 
      trial failure of new molecules. In this review, we provide an overview of the 
      current treatment strategies for tauopathies and the recent progress in drug 
      repurposing as an alternative approach to treat tauopathies.

AB  - Traditional drug development for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is costly, time 
      consuming and burdened by a very low success rate. An alternative strategy is 
      drug repositioning, redirecting existing drugs for another disease. The large 
      amount of biological data accumulated to date warrants a comprehensive 
      investigation to better understand AD pathogenesis and facilitate the process of 
      anti-AD drug repositioning. Hence, we generated a list of anti-AD protein targets 
      by analyzing the most recent publically available 'omics' data, including 
      genomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics data. The information related 
      to AD pathogenesis was obtained from the OMIM and PubMed databases. Drug-target 
      data was extracted from the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database. We 
      generated a list of 524 AD-related proteins, 18 of which are targets for 75 
      existing drugs-novel candidates for repurposing as anti-AD treatments. We 
      developed a ranking algorithm to prioritize the anti-AD targets, which revealed 
      CD33 and MIF as the strongest candidates with seven existing drugs. We also found 
      7 drugs inhibiting a known anti-AD target (acetylcholinesterase) that may be 
      repurposed for treating the cognitive symptoms of AD. The CAD protein and 8 
      proteins implicated by two 'omics' approaches (ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, PICALM, CELF1, 
      INPP5D, SPON1, and SOD3) might also be promising targets for anti-AD drug 
      development. Our systematic 'omics' mining suggested drugs with novel anti-AD 
      indications, including drugs modulating the immune system or reducing 
      neuroinflammation that are particularly promising for AD intervention. 
      Furthermore, the list of 524 AD-related proteins could be useful not only as 
      potential anti-AD targets but also considered for AD biomarker development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As global populations age and become susceptible to neurodegenerative 
      illnesses, new therapies for Alzheimer disease (AD) are urgently needed. Existing 
      data resources for drug discovery and repurposing fail to capture relationships 
      central to the disease's etiology and response to drugs. OBJECTIVE: We designed 
      the Alzheimer's Knowledge Base (AlzKB) to alleviate this need by providing a 
      comprehensive knowledge representation of AD etiology and candidate therapeutics. 
      METHODS: We designed the AlzKB as a large, heterogeneous graph knowledge base 
      assembled using 22 diverse external data sources describing biological and 
      pharmaceutical entities at different levels of organization (eg, chemicals, 
      genes, anatomy, and diseases). AlzKB uses a Web Ontology Language 2 ontology to 
      enforce semantic consistency and allow for ontological inference. We provide a 
      public version of AlzKB and allow users to run and modify local versions of the 
      knowledge base. RESULTS: AlzKB is freely available on the web and currently 
      contains 118,902 entities with 1,309,527 relationships between those entities. To 
      demonstrate its value, we used graph data science and machine learning to (1) 
      propose new therapeutic targets based on similarities of AD to Parkinson disease 
      and (2) repurpose existing drugs that may treat AD. For each use case, AlzKB 
      recovers known therapeutic associations while proposing biologically plausible 
      new ones. CONCLUSIONS: AlzKB is a new, publicly available knowledge resource that 
      enables researchers to discover complex translational associations for AD drug 
      discovery. Through 2 use cases, we show that it is a valuable tool for proposing 
      novel therapeutic hypotheses based on public biomedical knowledge.

TI  - Repurposing Vorinostat for the Treatment of Disorders Affecting Brain.
PG  - 449-465
LID - 10.1007/s12017-021-08660-4 [doi]
AB  - Based on the findings in recent years, we summarize the therapeutic potential of 
      vorinostat (VOR), the first approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, in 
      disorders of brain, and strategies to improve drug efficacy and reduce side 
      effects. Scientific evidences provide a strong case for the therapeutic utility 
      of VOR in various disorders affecting brain, including stroke, Alzheimer's 
      disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, X-linked 
      adrenoleukodystrophy, epilepsy, Niemann-Pick type C disease, and neuropsychiatric 
      disorders. Further elucidation of the neuroprotective and neurorestorative 
      properties of VOR using proper clinical study designs could provide momentum 
      towards its clinical application. To improve the therapeutic prospect, concerns 
      on systemic toxicity and off-target actions need to be addressed along with the 
      improvement in formulation and delivery aspects, especially with respect to 
      solubility, permeability, and pharmacokinetic properties. Newer approaches in 
      this regard include poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(DL-lactic acid) micelles, 
      VOR-pluronic F127 micelles, encapsulation of iron complexes of VOR into PEGylated 
      liposomes, human serum albumin bound VOR nanomedicine, magnetically guided 
      layer-by-layer assembled nanocarriers, as well as convection-enhanced delivery. 
      Even though targeting specific class or isoform of HDAC is projected as 
      advantageous over pan-HDAC inhibitor like VOR, in terms of adverse effects and 
      efficacy, till clinical validation, the idea is debated. As the VOR 
      treatment-related adverse changes are mostly found reversible, further 
      optimization of the therapeutic strategies with respect to dose, dosage regimen, 
      and formulations of VOR could propel its clinical prospects.

AB  - The evident genetic, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) poses challenges for traditional drug development. We conducted a 
      computational drug repurposing screen for drugs to treat apolipoprotein (apo) 
      E4-related AD. We first established apoE-genotype-dependent transcriptomic 
      signatures of AD by analyzing publicly-available human brain database. We then 
      queried these signatures against the Connectivity Map database containing 
      transcriptomic perturbations of >1300 drugs to identify those that best reverse 
      apoE-genotype-specific AD signatures. Bumetanide was identified as a top drug for 
      apoE4 AD. Bumetanide treatment of apoE4 mice without or with Aβ accumulation 
      rescued electrophysiological, pathological, or cognitive deficits. Single-nucleus 
      RNA-sequencing revealed transcriptomic reversal of AD signatures in specific cell 
      types in these mice, a finding confirmed in apoE4-iPSC-derived neurons. In 
      humans, bumetanide exposure was associated with a significantly lower AD 
      prevalence in individuals over the age of 65 in two electronic health record 
      databases, suggesting effectiveness of bumetanide in preventing AD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are disease that 
      bring an increased global burden. However, the medicine developed to date remains 
      limited. The purpose of this study is to predict drug repositioning candidates 
      using a computational method that integrates gene expression profiles on 
      Alzheimer's disease and compound-induced changes in gene expression levels. 
      METHODS: Gene expression data on Alzheimer's disease were obtained from the Gene 
      Expression Omnibus (GEO) and we conducted a meta-analysis of their gene 
      expression levels. The reverse scores of compound-induced gene expressions were 
      computed based on the reversal relationship between disease and drug gene 
      expression profiles. RESULTS: Reversal genes and the candidate compounds were 
      identified by the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. Additionally, the 
      half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values and the blood-brain barrier 
      (BBB) permeability of candidate compounds were obtained from ChEMBL and PubChem, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: New therapeutic target genes and drug candidates 
      against Alzheimer's disease were identified by means of drug repositioning.

TI  - Beyond "Psychotropic": Repurposing Psychiatric Drugs for COVID-19, Alzheimer's 
      Disease, and Cancer.
LID - 22r14494 [pii]
LID - 10.4088/JCP.22r14494 [doi]
AB  - Importance: "Psychotropic" drugs have widespread reach and impact throughout the 
      brain and body. Thus, many of these drugs could be repurposed for non-psychiatric 
      indications of high public health impact. Observations: The selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluvoxamine was shown efficacious as a COVID-19 
      treatment based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a benefit of other 
      antidepressants has been posited based on observational and preclinical studies. 
      In this review, we illuminate features of SSRIs and other psychiatric drugs that 
      make them candidates to repurpose for non-psychiatric indications. We summarize 
      research that led to fluvoxamine's use in COVID-19 and provide guidance on how to 
      use it safely. We summarize studies suggestive of benefit of other 
      antidepressants versus COVID-19 and long COVID. We also describe putative 
      mechanisms of psychiatric drugs in treating long COVID, Alzheimer's disease, 
      cancer, and other conditions. Conclusion and Relevance: There is a potentially 
      great clinical and public health impact of psychotropic drug repurposing. 
      Challenges exist to such repurposing efforts, but solutions exist for 
      researchers, regulators, and funders that overcome these challenges.

TI  - Epigenetic Drug Repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease Based on Epigenetic Targets 
      in Human Interactome.
PG  - 53-65
LID - 10.3233/JAD-161104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epigenetics has emerged as an important field in drug discovery. 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading neurodegenerative disorder throughout the 
      world, is shown to have an epigenetic basis. Currently, there are very few 
      effective epigenetic drugs available for AD. OBJECTIVE: In this work, for the 
      first time we have proposed 14 AD repositioning epigenetic drugs and identified 
      their targets from extensive human interactome. METHODS: Interacting partners of 
      the AD epigenetic proteins were identified from the extensive human interactome 
      to construct Epigenetic Protein-Protein Interaction Network (EP-PPIN). Epigenetic 
      Drug-Target Network (EP-DTN) was constructed with the drugs associated with the 
      proteins of EP-PPIN. Regulation of non-coding RNAs associated with the target 
      proteins of these drugs was also studied. AD related target proteins, epigenetic 
      targets, enriched pathways, and functional categories of the proposed 
      repositioning drugs were also studied. RESULTS: The proposed 14 AD epigenetic 
      repositioning drugs have overlapping targets and miRs with known AD epigenetic 
      targets and miRs. Furthermore, several shared functional categories and enriched 
      pathways were obtained for these drugs with FDA approved epigenetic drugs and 
      known AD drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our work might provide insight into 
      future AD epigenetic-therapeutics.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as a critical neurodegenerative disorder. It 
      worsens as symptoms concerning dementia grow severe over the years. Due to the 
      globalization of Alzheimer's disease, its prevention and treatment are vital. 
      This study proposes a method to extract substantial gene complexes and then 
      introduces potential drugs in Alzheimer's disease. To this end, a protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) network was utilized to extract five meaningful gene complexes 
      functionally interconnected. An enrichment analysis to introduce the most 
      important biological processes and pathways was accomplished on the obtained 
      genes. The next step is extracting the drugs related to AD and introducing some 
      new drugs which may be helpful for this disease. Finally, a complete network 
      including all the genes associated with each gene complex group and genes' target 
      drug was illustrated. For validating the proposed potential drugs, Connectivity 
      Map (CMAP) analysis was accomplished to determine target genes that are up- or 
      downregulated by proposed drugs. Medical studies and publications were analyzed 
      thoroughly to introduce AD-related drugs. This analysis proves the accuracy of 
      the proposed method in this study. Then, new drugs were introduced that can be 
      experimentally examined as future work. Raloxifene and gentian violet are two new 
      drugs, which have not been introduced as AD-related drugs in previous scientific 
      and medical studies, recommended by the method of this study. Besides the primary 
      goal, five bipartite networks representing the genes of each group and their 
      target miRNAs were constructed to introduce target miRNAs.

AB  - Peptides originating from different sources (endogenous, food derived, 
      environmental, and synthetic) are able to influence different aspects of 
      epigenetic regulation. Endogenous short peptides, resulting from proteolytic 
      cleavage of proteins or upon translation of non-annotated out of frame 
      transcripts, can block DNA methylation and hereby regulate gene expression. 
      Peptides entering the body by digestion of food-related proteins can modulate DNA 
      methylation and/or histone acetylation while environmental peptides, synthesized 
      by bacteria, fungi, and marine sponges, mainly inhibit histone deacetylation. In 
      addition, synthetic peptides that reverse or inhibit different epigenetic 
      modifications of both histones and the DNA can be developed as well. Next to 
      these DNA and histone modifications, peptides can also influence the expression 
      of non-coding RNAs such as lncRNAs and the maturation of miRNAs.Seen the 
      advantages over small molecules, the development of peptide therapeutics is an 
      interesting approach to treat diseases with a strong epigenetic basis like cancer 
      and Alzheimer's disease. To date, only a limited number of drugs with a proven 
      epigenetic mechanism of action have been approved by the FDA of which two 
      (romidepsin and nesiritide) are peptides. A large knowledge gap concerning 
      epigenetic effects of peptides is present, and this class of molecules deserves 
      more attention in the development as epigenetic modulators. In addition, none of 
      the currently approved peptide drugs are under investigation for their potential 
      effects on epigenetics, hampering drug repositioning of these peptides to other 
      indications with an epigenetic etiology.

TI  - Repurposed drugs targeting eIF2&alpha;-P-mediated translational repression 
      prevent neurodegeneration in mice.
PG  - 1768-1783
LID - 10.1093/brain/awx074 [doi]
AB  - See Mercado and Hetz (doi:10.1093/brain/awx107) for a scientific commentary on 
      this article.Signalling through the PERK/eIF2&alpha;-P branch of the unfolded 
      protein response plays a critical role in controlling protein synthesis rates in 
      cells. This pathway is overactivated in brains of patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s 
      disease and related disorders and has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic 
      target for these currently untreatable conditions. Thus, in mouse models of 
      neurodegenerative disease, prolonged overactivation of PERK/eIF2&alpha;-P 
      signalling causes sustained attenuation of protein synthesis, leading to memory 
      impairment and neuronal loss. Re-establishing translation rates by inhibition of 
      eIF2&alpha;-P activity, genetically or pharmacologically, restores memory and 
      prevents neurodegeneration and extends survival. However, the experimental 
      compounds used preclinically are unsuitable for use in humans, due to associated 
      toxicity or poor pharmacokinetic properties. To discover compounds that have 
      anti-eIF2&alpha;-P activity suitable for clinical use, we performed phenotypic 
      screens on a NINDS small molecule library of 1040 drugs. We identified two 
      compounds, trazodone hydrochloride and dibenzoylmethane, which reversed 
      eIF2&alpha;-P-mediated translational attenuation in&nbsp;vitro and in&nbsp;vivo. 
      Both drugs were markedly neuroprotective in two mouse models of 
      neurodegeneration, using clinically relevant doses over a prolonged period of 
      time, without systemic toxicity. Thus, in prion-diseased mice, both trazodone and 
      dibenzoylmethane treatment restored memory deficits, abrogated development of 
      neurological signs, prevented neurodegeneration and significantly prolonged 
      survival. In tauopathy-frontotemporal dementia mice, both drugs were 
      neuroprotective, rescued memory deficits and reduced hippocampal atrophy. 
      Further, trazodone reduced p-tau burden. These compounds therefore represent 
      potential new disease-modifying treatments for dementia. Trazodone in particular, 
      a licensed drug, should now be tested in clinical trials in patients.

TI  - Memantine in neurological disorders - schizophrenia and depression.
PG  - 327-334
LID - 10.1007/s00109-020-01982-z [doi]
AB  - Memantine is used in Alzheimer's disease treatment as a non-competitive 
      modern-affinity strong voltage-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
      antagonist. The fundamental role of these receptors is to bind glutamate: the 
      main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, believed to play a crucial role in 
      neuronal plasticity and learning mechanisms. Glutamate transmission plays an 
      important role in all internal CNS structures and maintains the physiological 
      state of the brain. Excessive glutamate transmission can lead to enlarged calcium 
      ion current which may cause neurotoxicity; however, insufficient transmission can 
      drastically alter the information flow in neurons and the brain, potentially 
      causing schizophrenia-like symptoms by replacing lost information with completely 
      new stimuli. Hence, it is possible that the modulation of NMDA activity may give 
      rise to pathophysiological states. Available literature and clinical trials 
      indicate that memantine is well tolerated by patients, with very few and light 
      side effects. There is a belief that memantine may also benefit other conditions 
      such as schizophrenia and depression.

TI  - Rose Bengal inhibits β-amyloid oligomers-induced tau hyperphosphorylation via 
      acting on Akt and CDK5 kinases.
PG  - 3579-3593
LID - 10.1007/s00213-022-06232-3 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation is considered as a main 
      pathological mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rose Bengal (RB) is a 
      synthetic dye used for disease diagnosis, which was reported to inhibit tau 
      toxicity via inhibiting tau aggregation in Drosophila. However, it was unknown if 
      RB could produce anti-AD effects in rodents. OBJECTIVES: The research aimed to 
      investigate if and how RB could prevent β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers-induced tau 
      hyperphosphorylation in rodents. METHODS AND RESULTS: RB was tested in vitro 
      (0.3-1 μM) and prevented Aβ oligomers-induced tau hyperphosphorylation in PC12 
      cells. Moreover, RB (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.) effectively attenuated cognitive 
      impairments induced by Aβ oligomers in mice. Western blotting analysis 
      demonstrated that RB significantly increased the expression of pSer473-Akt, 
      pSer9-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and reduced the expression of 
      cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) both in vitro and in vivo. Molecular docking 
      analysis suggested that RB might directly interact with GSK3β and CDK5 by acting 
      on ATP binding sites. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that RB might 
      act on protein phosphorylation pathways to inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: RB was shown to inhibit tau neurotoxicity at least partially via 
      inhibiting the activity of GSK3β and CDK5, which is a novel neuroprotective 
      mechanism besides the inhibition of tau aggregation. As tau hyperphosphorylation 
      is an important target for AD therapy, this study also provided support for 
      investigating the drug repurposing of RB as an anti-AD drug candidate.

AB  - The unmet need for the development of effective drugs to treat Alzheimer 's 
      disease has been steadily growing, representing a major challenge in drug 
      discovery. In this context, drug repurposing, namely the identification of novel 
      therapeutic indications for approved or investigational compounds, can be seen as 
      an attractive attempt to obtain new medications reducing both the time and the 
      economic burden usually required for research and development programs. In the 
      last years, several classes of drugs have evidenced promising beneficial effects 
      in neurodegenerative diseases, and for some of them, preliminary clinical trials 
      have been started. This review aims to illustrate some of the most recent 
      examples of drugs reprofiled for Alzheimer's disease, considering not only the 
      finding of new uses for existing drugs but also the new hypotheses on disease 
      pathogenesis that could promote previously unconsidered therapeutic regimens. 
      Moreover, some examples of structural modifications performed on existing drugs 
      in order to obtain multifunctional compounds will also be described.

AB  - Substantial evidence, composed of drug mechanisms of action, in vivo testing, and 
      epidemiological data, exists to support clinical testing of FDA-approved drugs 
      for repurposing to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Licensed compound 
      investigation can often proceed at a faster and more cost-effective manner than 
      un-approved compounds moving through the drug pipeline. As the prevalence of AD 
      increases with life expectancy, the current rise in life expectancy amalgamated 
      with the lack of an effective drug for the treatment of AD unnecessarily burdens 
      our medical system and is an urgent public health concern. The unfounded 
      reluctance to examine repurposing existing drugs for possible AD therapy further 
      impedes the possibility of improving the quality of patient lives with a terminal 
      disease. This review summarizes some evidence which exists to suggest certain 
      already-approved drugs may be considered for the treatment of AD and will perhaps 
      encourage physicians to off-label prescribe these safe therapeutics.

TI  - Cromolyn Reduces Levels of the Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Amyloid β-Protein 
      by Promoting Microglial Phagocytosis.

AB  - Amyloid-beta protein (Aβ) deposition is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). Aβ deposition triggers both pro-neuroinflammatory microglial 
      activation and neurofibrillary tangle formation. Cromolyn sodium is an asthma 
      therapeutic agent previously shown to reduce Aβ levels in transgenic AD mouse 
      brains after one-week of treatment. Here, we further explored these effects as 
      well as the mechanism of action of cromolyn, alone, and in combination with 
      ibuprofen in APP(Swedish)-expressing Tg2576 mice. Mice were treated for 3 months 
      starting at 5 months of age, when the earliest stages of β-amyloid deposition 
      begin. Cromolyn, alone, or in combination with ibuprofen, almost completely 
      abolished longer insoluble Aβ species, i.e. Aβ40 and Aβ42, but increased 
      insoluble Aβ38 levels. In addition to its anti-aggregation effects on Aβ, 
      cromolyn, alone, or plus ibuprofen, but not ibuprofen alone, increased microglial 
      recruitment to, and phagocytosis of β-amyloid deposits in AD mice. Cromolyn also 
      promoted Aβ42 uptake in microglial cell-based assays. Collectively, our data 
      reveal robust effects of cromolyn, alone, or in combination with ibuprofen, in 
      reducing aggregation-prone Aβ levels and inducing a neuroprotective microglial 
      activation state favoring Aβ phagocytosis versus a pro-neuroinflammatory state. 
      These findings support the use of cromolyn, alone, or with ibuprofen, as a 
      potential AD therapeutic.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present work reviews current evidence regarding the contribution 
      of machine learning to the discovery of new drug targets. METHODS: Scientific 
      articles from PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Web of Science Core Collection 
      published until May 2021 were included in this review. RESULTS: The most 
      significant areas of research are schizophrenia, depression and anxiety, 
      Alzheimer´s disease, and substance use disorders. ML techniques have pinpointed 
      target gene candidates and pathways, new molecular substances, and several 
      biomarkers regarding psychiatric disorders. Drug repositioning studies using ML 
      have identified multiple drug candidates as promising therapeutic agents. 
      CONCLUSION: Next-generation ML techniques and subsequent deep learning may power 
      new findings regarding the discovery of new pharmacological agents by bridging 
      the gap between biological data and chemical drug information.

AB  - Growth and immune process dysregulation can result in both cancer and 
      nonmalignant disease (hereditary or acquired, with and without predisposition to 
      malignancy). Moreover, perhaps unexpectedly, many nonmalignant illnesses harbor 
      genomic alterations indistinguishable from druggable oncogenic drivers. 
      Therefore, targeted compounds used successfully to treat cancer may have 
      therapeutic potential for nonmalignant conditions harboring the same target. MEK, 
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), and NRG1/ERBB pathway 
      genes have all been implicated in both cancer and noncancerous conditions, and 
      several cognate antagonists, as well as Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, JAK 
      inhibitors, and CD20-directed antibodies, have established or theoretical 
      therapeutic potential to bridge cancer and benign diseases. Intriguingly, 
      pharmacologically tractable cancer drivers characterize a wide spectrum of 
      disorders without malignant potential, including but not limited to Alzheimer's 
      disease and a variety of other neurodegenerative conditions, rheumatoid 
      arthritis, achondroplastic dwarfism, and endometriosis. Expanded repositioning of 
      oncology agents in order to benefit benign but serious medical illnesses is 
      warranted.

AB  - In the brain, acetylcholine (ACh) is regarded as one of the major 
      neurotransmitters. During the advancement of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cholinergic 
      deficits occur and this can lead to extensive cognitive dysfunction and decline. 
      Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) remains a highly feasible target for the symptomatic 
      improvement of AD. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) remains a highly viable target for 
      the symptomatic improvement in AD because cholinergic deficit is a consistent and 
      early finding in AD. The treatment approach of inhibiting peripheral AChE for 
      myasthenia gravis had effectively proven that AChE inhibition was a reachable 
      therapeutic target. Subsequently tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and 
      galantamine were developed and approved for the symptomatic treatment of AD. 
      Since then, multiple cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) have been continued to be 
      developed. These include newer ChEIs, naturally derived ChEIs, hybrids, and 
      synthetic analogues. In this paper, we summarize the different types of ChEIs 
      which are under development and their respective mechanisms of actions.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, 
      which affects millions of people worldwide. Accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and 
      hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tangles are the key mechanisms involved in 
      the etiopathogenesis of AD, characterized by memory loss and behavioural changes. 
      Effective therapies targeting AD pathogenesis are limited, making it the largest 
      unmet clinical need. Unfortunately, the available drugs provide symptomatic 
      relief and primary care, with no substantial impact on the disease pathology. 
      However, in recent years researchers are working hard on several potential 
      therapeutic targets to combat disease pathogenesis, and few drugs have also 
      reached clinical trials. In addition, drugs are being repurposed both in the 
      preclinical and clinical studies for the treatment of AD. For instance, 
      montelukast is the most commonly used leukotriene receptor antagonist for 
      treating asthma and seasonal allergy. Its leukotriene antagonistic action can 
      also be beneficial for the reduction of detrimental effects of leukotriene 
      against neuro-inflammation, a hallmark feature of AD. The available marketed 
      formulations of montelukast present challenges such as poor bioavailability and 
      reduced uptake, reflecting the lack of effectiveness of its desired action in the 
      CNS. While on the other side, targeted drug delivery is a satisfactory approach 
      to surpass the challenges associated with the therapeutic agents. This review 
      will discuss the enhancement of montelukast treatment efficacy and its access to 
      CNS by using new approaches like nano-formulation, nasal gel, solid lipid 
      formulation, nano-structure lipid carrier (NSLC), highlighting lessons learned to 
      target AD pathologies and hurdles that persist.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disease that threatens the elderly. No efficient 
      therapeutic method is currently available to combat AD. Drug repurposing has 
      provided a new route for AD drug discovery, and medical genetics has shown 
      potential in target-based drug repurposing. We compared AD-associated genes with 
      approved drug targets and found that three are targeted by 23 approved drugs. 
      Thus, these drugs may be used to treat AD according to the medical genetic 
      information of the targets. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that four 
      drugs, all of which are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, had 
      potential to treat AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major form of dementia prevalent in older adults 
      and with a high incidence in females. Identification of early biomarkers is 
      essential for preventive intervention to delay its progression. Furthermore, due 
      to its multifactorial nature, a multi-target approach could be therapeutically 
      beneficial. Our studies included 4- (pre-pathology) and 11-month (mild-pathology) 
      TgF344-AD rats, a transgenic Alzheimer's model that exhibits age-dependent AD 
      progression. We identified two potential early biomarker genes for AD, early 
      growth response 2 (EGR2) and histone 1H2AA (HIST1H2AA), in the hippocampus of 
      4-month females. Out of 17,168 genes analyzed by RNA sequencing, expression of 
      these two genes was significantly altered in 4-month TgF344-AD rats compared to 
      wild-type littermates. We also evaluated co-treatment with diazoxide (DZ), a 
      potassium channel activator, and dibenzoylmethane (DIB), which inhibits eIF2α-P 
      activity, on TgF344-AD and wild-type rats. DZ/DIB-treatment mitigated spatial 
      memory deficits and buildup of hippocampal Aβ plaques and tau PHF in 11-month 
      TgF344-AD rats but had no effect on wild-type littermates. To our knowledge, this 
      preclinical study is the first to report EGR2 and HIST1H2AA as potential AD 
      biomarkers in females, and the benefits of DZ/DIB-treatment in AD. Evaluations 
      across multiple AD-related models is warranted to corroborate our findings.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are of vast origin which are characterized by 
      gradual progressive loss of neurons in the brain region. ND can be classified 
      according to the clinical symptoms present (e.g. Cognitive decline, hyperkinetic, 
      and hypokinetic movements disorder) or by the pathological protein deposited 
      (e.g., Amyloid, tau, Alpha-synuclein, TDP-43). Alzheimer's disease preceded by 
      Parkinson's is the most prevalent form of ND world-wide. Multiple factors like 
      aging, genetic mutations, environmental factors, gut microbiota, blood-brain 
      barrier microvascular complication, etc. may increase the predisposition towards 
      ND. Genetic mutation is a major contributor in increasing the susceptibility 
      towards ND, the concept of one disease-one gene is obsolete and now multiple 
      genes are considered to be involved in causing one particular disease. Also, the 
      involvement of multiple pathological mechanisms like oxidative stress, 
      neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, etc. contributes to the complexity 
      and makes them difficult to be treated by traditional mono-targeted ligands. In 
      this aspect, the Poly-pharmacological drug approach which targets multiple 
      pathological pathways at the same time provides the best way to treat such 
      complex networked CNS diseases. In this review, we have provided an overview of 
      ND and their pathological origin, along with a brief description of various genes 
      associated with multiple diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple 
      sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's and a 
      comprehensive detail about the Poly-pharmacology approach (MTDLs and Fixed-dose 
      combinations) along with their merits over the traditional single-targeted drug 
      is provided. This review also provides insights into current repurposing 
      strategies along with its regulatory considerations.

AB  - Target trial emulation is the process of mimicking target randomized trials using 
      real-world data, where effective confounding control for unbiased treatment 
      effect estimation remains a main challenge. Although various approaches have been 
      proposed for this challenge, a systematic evaluation is still lacking. Here we 
      emulated trials for thousands of medications from two large-scale real-world data 
      warehouses, covering over 10 years of clinical records for over 170 million 
      patients, aiming to identify new indications of approved drugs for Alzheimer's 
      disease. We assessed different propensity score models under the inverse 
      probability of treatment weighting framework and suggested a model selection 
      strategy for improved baseline covariate balancing. We also found that the deep 
      learning-based propensity score model did not necessarily outperform logistic 
      regression-based methods in covariate balancing. Finally, we highlighted five 
      top-ranked drugs (pantoprazole, gabapentin, atorvastatin, fluticasone, and 
      omeprazole) originally intended for other indications with potential benefits for 
      Alzheimer's patients.

TI  - Marine Natural Products, Multitarget Therapy and Repurposed Agents in Alzheimer's 
      Disease.
LID - 10.3390/ph13090242 [doi]
LID - 242
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease characterized by the 
      presence of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and nerve cell death that 
      affects, mainly, older people. After decades of investigation, the search for an 
      efficacious treatment for AD remains and several strategies can be and are being 
      employed in this journey. In this review, four of the most promising strategies, 
      alongside with its most promising agents under investigation or development are 
      highlighted. Marine natural products (MNP) are a source of unique chemical 
      structures with useful biological activities for AD treatment. One of the most 
      promising compounds, a marine-derived acidic oligosaccharide (GV-971) just passed 
      phase III clinical trials with a unique mechanism of action. Combination therapy 
      and multitargeted-directed ligand therapy (MTDL) are also two important 
      strategies, with several examples in clinical trials, based on the belief that 
      the best approach for AD is a therapy capable of modulating multiple target 
      pathways. Drug repurposing, a strategy that requires a smaller investment and is 
      less time consuming, is emerging as a strong contender with a variety of 
      pharmacological agents resurfacing in an attempt to identify a therapeutic 
      candidate capable of modifying the course of this disease.

TI  - Modeling Path Importance for Effective Alzheimer's Disease Drug Repurposing.
LID - arXiv:2310.15211v2
AB  - Recently, drug repurposing has emerged as an effective and resource-efficient 
      paradigm for AD drug discovery. Among various methods for drug repurposing, 
      network-based methods have shown promising results as they are capable of 
      leveraging complex networks that integrate multiple interaction types, such as 
      protein-protein interactions, to more effectively identify candidate drugs. 
      However, existing approaches typically assume paths of the same length in the 
      network have equal importance in identifying the therapeutic effect of drugs. 
      Other domains have found that same length paths do not necessarily have the same 
      importance. Thus, relying on this assumption may be deleterious to drug 
      repurposing attempts. In this work, we propose MPI (Modeling Path Importance), a 
      novel network-based method for AD drug repurposing. MPI is unique in that it 
      prioritizes important paths via learned node embeddings, which can effectively 
      capture a network's rich structural information. Thus, leveraging learned 
      embeddings allows MPI to effectively differentiate the importance among paths. We 
      evaluate MPI against a commonly used baseline method that identifies anti-AD drug 
      candidates primarily based on the shortest paths between drugs and AD in the 
      network. We observe that among the top-50 ranked drugs, MPI prioritizes 20.0% 
      more drugs with anti-AD evidence compared to the baseline. Finally, Cox 
      proportional-hazard models produced from insurance claims data aid us in 
      identifying the use of etodolac, nicotine, and BBB-crossing ACE-INHs as having a 
      reduced risk of AD, suggesting such drugs may be viable candidates for 
      repurposing and should be explored further in future studies.

TI  - Finding off-targets, biological pathways, and target diseases for chymase 
      inhibitors via structure-based systems biology approach.
PG  - 1209-24
LID - 10.1002/prot.24677 [doi]
AB  - Off-target binding connotes the binding of a small molecule of therapeutic 
      significance to a protein target in addition to the primary target for which it 
      was proposed. Progressively such off-targeting is emerging to be regular practice 
      to reveal side effects. Chymase is an enzyme of hydrolase class that catalyzes 
      hydrolysis of peptide bonds. A link between heart failure and chymase is 
      ascribed, and a chymase inhibitor is in clinical phase II for treatment of heart 
      failure. However, the underlying mechanisms of the off-target effects of human 
      chymase inhibitors are still unclear. Here, we develop a robust computational 
      strategy that is applicable to any enzyme system and that allows the prediction 
      of drug effects on biological processes. Putative off-targets for chymase 
      inhibitors were identified through various structural and functional similarity 
      analyses along with molecular docking studies. Finally, literature survey was 
      performed to incorporate these off-targets into biological pathways and to 
      establish links between pathways and particular adverse effects. Off-targets of 
      chymase inhibitors are linked to various biological pathways such as classical 
      and lectin pathways of complement system, intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of 
      coagulation cascade, and fibrinolytic system. Tissue kallikreins, granzyme M, 
      neutrophil elastase, and mesotrypsin are also identified as off-targets. These 
      off-targets and their associated pathways are elucidated for the effects of 
      inflammation, cancer, hemorrhage, thrombosis, and central nervous system diseases 
      (Alzheimer's disease). Prospectively, our approach is helpful not only to better 
      understand the mechanisms of chymase inhibitors but also for drug repurposing 
      exercises to find novel uses for these inhibitors.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is one of the most progressive forms of dementia, ultimately 
      leading to death in aged populations. The major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease 
      include deposition of extracellular amyloid senile plaques and intracellular 
      neurofibrillary tangles in brain neuronal cells. Although there are classical 
      therapeutic options available for the treatment of the diseases, however, they 
      provide only a symptomatic relief and do not modify the molecular 
      pathophysiological course of the disease. Recent research advances in Alzheimer's 
      disease have highlighted the potential role of anti-amyloid, anti-tau, and 
      anti-inflammatory therapies. However, these therapies are still in different 
      phases of pre-clinical/clinical development. In addition, drug 
      repositioning/repurposing is another interesting and promising approach to 
      explore rationalized options for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This 
      review discusses the different aspects of the pathophysiological mechanism 
      involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease along with the limitations of 
      current therapies. Furthermore, this review also highlights emerging 
      investigational drugs along with recent drug repurposing approaches for 
      Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by its complex and heterogeneous 
      etiology and gradual progression, leading to high drug failure rates in 
      late-stage clinical trials. In order to better stratify individuals at risk for 
      AD and discern potential therapeutic targets we employed a novel procedure 
      utilizing cell-based co-regulated gene networks and polygenic risk scores 
      (cbPRSs). After defining genetic subtypes using extremes of cbPRS distributions, 
      we evaluated correlations of the genetic subtypes with previously defined AD 
      subtypes defined on the basis of domain-specific cognitive functioning and 
      neuroimaging biomarkers. Employing a PageRank algorithm, we identified priority 
      gene targets for the genetic subtypes. Pathway analysis of priority genes 
      demonstrated associations with neurodegeneration and suggested candidate drugs 
      currently utilized in diabetes, hypertension, and epilepsy for repositioning in 
      AD. Experimental validation utilizing human induced pluripotent stem cell 
      (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes demonstrated the modifying effects of estradiol, 
      levetiracetam, and pioglitazone on expression of APOE and complement C4 genes, 
      suggesting potential repositioning for AD.

AB  - Lipid metabolism is abnormal in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain leading to 
      ceramide and sphingosine accumulation and reduced levels of brain 
      sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). We hypothesize that changes in S1P signaling are 
      central to the inflammatory and immune-pathogenesis of AD and the therapeutic 
      benefits of fingolimod, a structural analog of sphingosine that is FDA approved 
      for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. We recently reported that the 
      neuroprotective effects of fingolimod in 5xFAD transgenic AD mice treated from 
      1-3 months of age were greater at 1 mg/kg/day than at 5 mg/kg/day. Here we 
      performed a dose-response study using fingolimod from 0.03 to 1 mg/kg/day in 
      5xFAD mice treated from 1-8 months of age. At 1 mg/kg/day, fingolimod decreased 
      both peripheral blood lymphocyte counts and brain Aβ levels, but at the lowest 
      dose tested (0.03 mg/kg/day), we detected improved memory, decreased activation 
      of brain microglia and astrocytes, and restored hippocampal levels of GABA and 
      glycerophosphocholine with no effect on circulating lymphocyte counts. These 
      findings suggests that, unlike the case in multiple sclerosis, fingolimod may 
      potentially have therapeutic benefits in AD at low doses that do not affect 
      peripheral lymphocyte function.

AB  - Heparin is one of the oldest drugs, which nevertheless remains in widespread 
      clinical use as an inhibitor of blood coagulation. The history of its 
      identification a century ago unfolded amid one of the most fascinating scientific 
      controversies turning around the distribution of credit for its discovery. The 
      composition, purification and structure-function relationship of this naturally 
      occurring glycosaminoglycan regarding its classical role as anticoagulant will be 
      dealt with before proceeding to discuss its therapeutic potential in, among 
      other, inflammatory and infectious disease, cancer treatment, cystic fibrosis and 
      Alzheimer's disease. The first bibliographic reference hit using the words 
      'nanomedicine' and 'heparin' is as recent as 2008. Since then, nanomedical 
      applications of heparin have experienced an exponential growth that will be 
      discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on its antimalarial activity. Some 
      of the most intriguing potential applications of heparin nanomedicines will be 
      exposed, such as those contemplating the delivery of drugs to the mosquito stages 
      of malaria parasites.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious degenerative brain disease and 
      the most common cause of dementia. The current available drugs for AD provide 
      symptomatic benefit, but there is no effective drug to cure the disease. The 
      emergence of large-scale genomic, pharmacological data provides new opportunities 
      for drug discovery and drug repositioning as a promising strategy in searching 
      novel drug for AD. RESULTS: In this study, we took advantage of our increasing 
      understanding based on systems biology approaches on the pathway and network 
      levels and perturbation datasets from the Library of Integrated Network-Based 
      Cellular Signatures to introduce a systematic computational process to discover 
      new drugs implicated in AD. First, we collected 561 genes that have reported to 
      be risk genes of AD, and applied functional enrichment analysis on these genes. 
      Then, by quantifying proximity between 5595 molecule drugs and AD based on human 
      interactome, we filtered out 1092 drugs that were proximal to the disease. We 
      further performed an Inverted Gene Set Enrichment analysis on these drug 
      candidates, which allowed us to estimate effect of perturbations on gene 
      expression and identify 24 potential drug candidates for AD treatment. Results 
      from this study also provided insights for understanding the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying AD. As a useful systematic method, our approach can also be used to 
      identify efficacious therapies for other complex diseases. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available at

TI  - Research and development of anti-Alzheimer's disease drugs: an update from the 
      perspective of technology flows.
PG  - 341-350
LID - 10.1080/13543776.2018.1439475 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Today, over 20 million people suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      worldwide. AD has become a critical issue to human health, especially in aging 
      societies, and therefore it is a research hotspot in the global scientific 
      community. The technology flow method differs from traditional reviews generating 
      an informative overview of the research and development (R&D) landscape in a 
      specific technological area. We need such an updated method to get a general 
      overview of the R&D of anti-AD drugs in light of the dramatic developments in 
      this area in recent years. AREAS COVERED: This study collects patent data from 
      the Integrity database. A total of 399 patents with 821 internal citation pairs 
      in the US from 1978 to 2017 were analyzed. Patent citation network analysis was 
      used to visualize the technology relationship. EXPERT OPINION: For better 
      production of anti-AD drugs, governments should emphasize the multi-target drug 
      design, provide policy support for private companies, and encourage multilateral 
      cooperation. The β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) theory leaves much to be desired; 
      neurotransmitter and tau protein hypotheses are worth further examination. The 
      use of old drugs for new indications is promising, as are traditional herbal 
      medicines.

TI  - Repositioning of Memantine as a Potential Novel Therapeutic Agent against 
      Meningitic E. coli-Induced Pathogenicities through Disease-Associated Alpha7 
      Cholinergic Pathway and RNA Sequencing-Based Transcriptome Analysis of Host 
      Inflammatory Responses.

AB  - Neonatal sepsis and meningitis (NSM) remains a leading cause worldwide of 
      mortality and morbidity in newborn infants despite the availability of 
      antibiotics over the last several decades. E. coli is the most common 
      gram-negative pathogen causing NSM. Our previous studies show that α7 nicotinic 
      receptor (α7 nAChR), an essential regulator of inflammation, plays a detrimental 
      role in the host defense against NSM. Despite notable successes, there still 
      exists an unmet need for new effective therapeutic approaches to treat this 
      disease. Using the in vitro/in vivo models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and 
      RNA-seq, we undertook a drug repositioning study to identify unknown 
      antimicrobial activities for known drugs. We have demonstrated for the first time 
      that memantine (MEM), a FDA-approved drug for treatment of Alzheimer's disease, 
      could very efficiently block E. coli-caused bacteremia and meningitis in a mouse 
      model of NSM in a manner dependent on α7 nAChR. MEM was able to synergistically 
      enhance the antibacterial activity of ampicillin in HBMEC infected with E. coli 
      K1 (E44) and in neonatal mice with E44-caused bacteremia and meningitis. 
      Differential gene expression analysis of RNA-Seq data from mouse BMEC infected 
      with E. coli K1 showed that several E44-increased inflammatory factors, including 
      IL33, IL18rap, MMP10 and Irs1, were significantly reduced by MEM compared to the 
      infected cells without drug treatment. MEM could also significantly up-regulate 
      anti-inflammatory factors, including Tnfaip3, CISH, Ptgds and Zfp36. Most 
      interestingly, these factors may positively and negatively contribute to 
      regulation of NF-κB, which is a hallmark feature of bacterial meningitis. 
      Furthermore, we have demonstrated that circulating BMEC (cBMEC) are the potential 
      novel biomarkers for NSM. MEM could significantly reduce E44-increased blood 
      level of cBMEC in mice. Taken together, our data suggest that memantine can 
      efficiently block host inflammatory responses to bacterial infection through 
      modulation of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways.

TI  - Antineoplastics for treating Alzheimer's disease and dementia: Evidence from 
      preclinical and observational studies.
LID - 10.1002/med.22033 [doi]
AB  - As the world population ages, there will be an increasing need for effective 
      therapies for aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders, which remain 
      untreatable. Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading 
      neurological diseases in the aging population. Current therapeutic approaches to 
      treat this disorder are solely symptomatic, making the need for new molecular 
      entities acting on the causes of the disease extremely urgent. One of the 
      potential solutions is to use compounds that are already in the market. The 
      structures have known pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity profiles, and 
      patient data available in several countries. Several drugs have been used 
      successfully to treat diseases different from their original purposes, such as 
      autoimmunity and peripheral inflammation. Herein, we divulge the repurposing of 
      drugs in the area of neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on the therapeutic 
      potential of antineoplastics to treat dementia due to AD and dementia. We briefly 
      touch upon the shared pathological mechanism between AD and cancer and drug 
      repurposing strategies, with a focus on artificial intelligence. Next, we bring 
      out the current status of research on the development of drugs, provide 
      supporting evidence from retrospective, clinical, and preclinical studies on 
      antineoplastic use, and bring in new areas, such as repurposing drugs for the 
      prion-like spreading of pathologies in treating AD.

TI  - Do Cancer Drugs Counteract Neurodegeneration? Repurposing for Alzheimer's 
      Disease.
PG  - 1295-1306
LID - 10.3233/JAD-160840 [doi]
AB  - In spite of in depth investigations in the field of the amyloid cascade 
      hypothesis, so far, no disease modifying therapy has been developed for 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathophysiology provides some evidence of the 
      inverse correlation between cancer and AD. Both AD and cancer are characterized 
      by abnormal cellular behaviors; trigger factors along with a meta synchronously 
      action is expected to drive cancer or neurodegeneration, supporting, 
      respectively, progressive neuronal loss or uncontrolled cell proliferation in 
      cancer cells. So far, cancer and AD are seemingly two opposite ends of the same 
      biological spectrum. Basic science increasingly indicates shared molecular 
      mechanisms between cancer and AD and gives weight to key relevant biological 
      theories; according to them, the inverse tuning of clustered gene expression, the 
      sharing of mutual independent pathway or the deregulated unfolded proteins system 
      (UPR) may count for this inverse association. Additionally, the common biological 
      background gave credibility to the recent discovery of a repurposing role for 
      cancer drugs in AD. It refers to the development of new uses for existing 
      pharmaceuticals having the same role as the original mechanism or to the 
      discovery of a new drug action with disease modifying effects. The present review 
      summarizes the most important biological theories that link neurodegeneration and 
      cancer and provides an up-to-date revision of the repurposing cancer agents for 
      AD. The review also addresses the gap of knowledge, since drug cancer 
      repositioning holds an important promise but further investigations are warranted 
      to ascertain the clinical relevance of such attractive clinical candidate 
      compounds for AD.

TI  - Conformational diversity and protein-protein interfaces in drug repurposing in 
      Ras signaling pathway.
PG  - 1239

LID - 1239
AB  - We focus on drug repurposing in the Ras signaling pathway, considering structural 
      similarities of protein-protein interfaces. The interfaces formed by physically 
      interacting proteins are found from PDB if available and via PRISM (PRotein 
      Interaction by Structural Matching) otherwise. The structural coverage of these 
      interactions has been increased from 21 to 92% using PRISM. Multiple 
      conformations of each protein are used to include protein dynamics and diversity. 
      Next, we find FDA-approved drugs bound to structurally similar protein-protein 
      interfaces. The results suggest that HIV protease inhibitors tipranavir, 
      indinavir, and saquinavir may bind to EGFR and ERBB3/HER3 interface. Tipranavir 
      and indinavir may also bind to EGFR and ERBB2/HER2 interface. Additionally, a 
      drug used in Alzheimer's disease can bind to RAF1 and BRAF interface. Hence, we 
      propose a methodology to find drugs to be potentially used for cancer using a 
      dataset of structurally similar protein-protein interface clusters rather than 
      pockets in a systematic way.

TI  - A drug repositioning algorithm based on a deep autoencoder and adaptive fusion.
PG  - 532
LID - 10.1186/s12859-021-04406-y [doi]
LID - 532
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug repositioning has caught the attention of scholars at home and 
      abroad due to its effective reduction of the development cost and time of new 
      drugs. However, existing drug repositioning methods that are based on 
      computational analysis are limited by sparse data and classic fusion methods; 
      thus, we use autoencoders and adaptive fusion methods to calculate drug 
      repositioning. RESULTS: In this study, a drug repositioning algorithm based on a 
      deep autoencoder and adaptive fusion was proposed to mitigate the problems of 
      decreased precision and low-efficiency multisource data fusion caused by data 
      sparseness. Specifically, a drug is repositioned by fusing drug-disease 
      associations, drug target proteins, drug chemical structures and drug side 
      effects. First, drug feature data integrated by drug target proteins and chemical 
      structures were processed with dimension reduction via a deep autoencoder to 
      characterize feature representations more densely and abstractly. Then, disease 
      similarity was computed using drug-disease association data, while drug 
      similarity was calculated with drug feature and drug-side effect data. 
      Predictions of drug-disease associations were also calculated using a top-k 
      neighbor method that is commonly used in predictive drug repositioning studies. 
      Finally, a predicted matrix for drug-disease associations was acquired after 
      fusing a wide variety of data via adaptive fusion. Based on experimental results, 
      the proposed algorithm achieves a higher precision and recall rate than the 
      DRCFFS, SLAMS and BADR algorithms with the same dataset. CONCLUSION: The proposed 
      algorithm contributes to investigating the novel uses of drugs, as shown in a 
      case study of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can provide 
      an auxiliary effect for clinical trials of drug repositioning.

TI  - Repurposing drugs against Alzheimer's disease: can the anti-multiple sclerosis 
      drug fingolimod (FTY720) effectively tackle inflammation processes in AD?
PG  - 1003-1012
LID - 10.1007/s00702-023-02618-5 [doi]
AB  - Therapeutic approaches providing effective medication for Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) patients after disease onset are urgently needed. Previous studies in AD 
      mouse models and in humans suggested that physical exercise or changed lifestyle 
      can delay AD-related synaptic and memory dysfunctions when treatment started in 
      juvenile animals or in elderly humans before onset of disease symptoms. However, 
      a pharmacological treatment that can reverse memory deficits in AD patients was 
      thus far not identified. Importantly, AD disease-related dysfunctions have 
      increasingly been associated with neuro-inflammatory mechanisms and searching for 
      anti-inflammatory medication to treat AD seems promising. Like for other 
      diseases, repurposing of FDA-approved drugs for treatment of AD is an ideally 
      suited strategy to reduce the time to bring such medication into clinical 
      practice. Of note, the sphingosine-1-phosphate analogue fingolimod (FTY720) was 
      FDA-approved in 2010 for treatment of multiple sclerosis patients. It binds to 
      the five different isoforms of Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs) that are 
      widely distributed across human organs. Interestingly, recent studies in five 
      different mouse models of AD suggest that FTY720 treatment, even when starting 
      after onset of AD symptoms, can reverse synaptic deficits and memory dysfunction 
      in these AD mouse models. Furthermore, a very recent multi-omics study identified 
      mutations in the sphingosine/ceramide pathway as a risk factor for sporadic AD, 
      suggesting S1PRs as promising drug target in AD patients. Therefore, progressing 
      with FDA-approved S1PR modulators into human clinical trials might pave the way 
      for these potential disease modifying anti-AD drugs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial disorder characterized by extracellular 
      accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary 
      tangles. Numerous drug targets have been explored for therapeutic efficacy but 
      failed to deliver successful treatments clinically. However, over the years our 
      understanding of the disease pathophysiology increased significantly. Many of the 
      novel targets which can cure or modify disease pathology are being explored 
      preclinically as well as clinically. On contrarily, the drug discovery and 
      development process is lengthy and the cost involved makes it difficult for 
      faster translation of therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, repurposing existing drugs 
      for a new therapeutic indication is considered a better approach and helps in the 
      fast translation of therapeutic information. The existing drugs have well-proven 
      records on their safety, pharmacokinetics, etc. In recent years, beta (β)-lactam 
      antibiotics have been repurposed for the management of neurodegenerative 
      pathologies. Here in the current review, we have explored β-lactam antibiotics, 
      their target sites, molecular mechanisms, and their therapeutic potential in 
      Alzheimer's disease.

      Prediction.
LID - 2024.07.03.601339 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2024.07.03.601339 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, 
      continues to increase in prevalence without any effective treatments to date. In 
      this context, knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a pivotal tool in biomedical 
      research, offering new perspectives on drug repurposing and biomarker discovery 
      by analyzing intricate network structures. Our study seeks to build an 
      AD-specific knowledge graph, highlighting interactions among AD, genes, variants, 
      chemicals, drugs, and other diseases. The goal is to shed light on existing 
      treatments, potential targets, and diagnostic methods for AD, thereby aiding in 
      drug repurposing and the identification of biomarkers. RESULTS: We annotated 800 
      PubMed abstracts and leveraged GPT-4 for text augmentation to enrich our training 
      data for named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification. A 
      comprehensive data mining model, integrating NER and relationship classification, 
      was trained on the annotated corpus. This model was subsequently applied to 
      extract relation triplets from unannotated abstracts. To enhance entity linking, 
      we utilized a suite of reference biomedical databases and refine the linking 
      accuracy through abbreviation resolution. As a result, we successfully identified 
      3,199,276 entity mentions and 633,733 triplets, elucidating connections between 
      5,000 unique entities. These connections were pivotal in constructing a 
      comprehensive Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Graph (ADKG). We also integrated the 
      ADKG constructed after entity linking with other biomedical databases. The ADKG 
      served as a training ground for Knowledge Graph Embedding models with the 
      high-ranking predicted triplets supported by evidence, underscoring the utility 
      of ADKG in generating testable scientific hypotheses. Further application of ADKG 
      in predictive modeling using the UK Biobank data revealed models based on ADKG 
      outperforming others, as evidenced by higher values in the areas under the 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. CONCLUSION: The ADKG is a 
      valuable resource for generating hypotheses and enhancing predictive models, 
      highlighting its potential to advance AD's disease research and treatment 
      strategies.

TI  - Dual Drug Repurposing: The Example of Saracatinib.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25084565 [doi]
LID - 4565
AB  - Saracatinib (AZD0530) is a dual Src/Abl inhibitor initially developed by 
      AstraZeneca for cancer treatment; however, data from 2006 to 2024 reveal that 
      this drug has been tested not only for cancer treatment, but also for the 
      treatment of other diseases. Despite the promising pre-clinical results and the 
      tolerability shown in phase I trials, where a maximum tolerated dose of 175 mg 
      was defined, phase II clinical data demonstrated a low therapeutic action against 
      several cancers and an elevated rate of adverse effects. Recently, pre-clinical 
      research aimed at reducing the toxic effects and enhancing the therapeutic 
      performance of saracatinib using nanoparticles and different pharmacological 
      combinations has shown promising results. Concomitantly, saracatinib was 
      repurposed to treat Alzheimer's disease, targeting Fyn. It showed great clinical 
      results and required a lower daily dose than that defined for cancer treatment, 
      125 mg and 175 mg, respectively. In addition to Alzheimer's disease, this Src 
      inhibitor has also been studied in relation to other health conditions such as 
      pulmonary and liver fibrosis and even for analgesic and anti-allergic functions. 
      Although saracatinib is still not approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA), the large number of alternative uses for saracatinib and the elevated 
      number of pre-clinical and clinical trials performed suggest the huge potential 
      of this drug for the treatment of different kinds of diseases.

TI  - Therapeutic Targeting of Repurposed Anticancer Drugs in Alzheimer's Disease: 
      Using the Multiomics Approach.
PG  - 13870-13887
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.1c01526 [doi]
AB  - AIM/HYPOTHESIS: The complexity and heterogeneity of multiple pathological 
      features make Alzheimer's disease (AD) a major culprit to global health. Drug 
      repurposing is an inexpensive and reliable approach to redirect the existing 
      drugs for new indications. The current study aims to study the possibility of 
      repurposing approved anticancer drugs for AD treatment. We proposed an in silico 
      pipeline based on "omics" data mining that combines genomics, transcriptomics, 
      and metabolomics studies. We aimed to validate the neuroprotective properties of 
      repurposed drugs and to identify the possible mechanism of action of the proposed 
      drugs in AD. RESULTS: We generated a list of AD-related genes and then searched 
      DrugBank database and Therapeutic Target Database to find anticancer drugs 
      related to potential AD targets. Specifically, we researched the available 
      approved anticancer drugs and excluded the information of investigational and 
      experimental drugs. We developed a computational pipeline to prioritize the 
      anticancer drugs having a close association with AD targets. From data mining, we 
      generated a list of 2914 AD-related genes and obtained 49 potential druggable 
      targets by functional enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
      studies for these genes revealed 641 interactions. We found that 15 AD 
      risk/direct PPI genes were associated with 30 approved oncology drugs. The 
      computational validation of candidate drug-target interactions, structural and 
      functional analysis, investigation of related molecular mechanisms, and 
      literature-based analysis resulted in four repurposing candidates, of which three 
      drugs were epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Our 
      computational drug repurposing approach proposed EGFR inhibitors as potential 
      repurposing drugs for AD. Consequently, our proposed framework could be used for 
      drug repurposing for different indications in an economical and efficient way.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by progressive memory loss. The main pathological features of the 
      disease are extracellular deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular 
      neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. 
      Understanding factors contributing to AD progression, the number of molecular 
      signatures, and the development of therapeutic agents played a significant role 
      in the discovery of disease-modifying drugs to treat the disease. Bioinformatics 
      has established its significance in many areas of biology. The role of 
      bioinformatics in drug discovery, is emerging significantly and will continue to 
      evolve. In recent years, different bioinformatics methodologies, viz. protein 
      signaling pathway, molecular signature differences between different classes of 
      drugs, interacting profiles of drugs and their potential therapeutic mechanisms, 
      have been applied to identify potential therapeutic targets of AD. Bioinformatics 
      tools were also found to contribute to the discovery of novel drugs, omics-based 
      biomarkers, and drug repurposing for AD. The review aims to explore the 
      applications of various advanced bioinformatics tools in the identification of 
      targets, biomarkers, pathways, and potential therapeutics for the treatment of 
      the disease.

TI  - DOTA: Deep Learning Optimal Transport Approach to Advance Drug Repositioning for 
      Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 10.3390/biom12020196 [doi]
LID - 196
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of age-related dementia, affecting 
      over 5 million people in the United States and incurring a substantial global 
      healthcare cost. Unfortunately, current treatments are only palliative and do not 
      cure AD. There is an urgent need to develop novel anti-AD therapies; however, 
      drug discovery is a time-consuming, expensive, and high-risk process. Drug 
      repositioning, on the other hand, is an attractive approach to identify drugs for 
      AD treatment. Thus, we developed a novel deep learning method called DOTA (Drug 
      repositioning approach using Optimal Transport for Alzheimer's disease) to 
      repurpose effective FDA-approved drugs for AD. Specifically, DOTA consists of two 
      major autoencoders: (1) a multi-modal autoencoder to integrate heterogeneous drug 
      information and (2) a Wasserstein variational autoencoder to identify effective 
      AD drugs. Using our approach, we predict that antipsychotic drugs with circadian 
      effects, such as quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, suvorexant, 
      brexpiprazole, olanzapine, and trazadone, will have efficacious effects in AD 
      patients. These drugs target important brain receptors involved in memory, 
      learning, and cognition, including serotonin 5-HT2A, dopamine D2, and orexin 
      receptors. In summary, DOTA repositions promising drugs that target important 
      biological pathways and are predicted to improve patient cognition, circadian 
      rhythms, and AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Big data and (deep) machine learning have been ambitious tools in digital 
      medicine, but these tools focus mainly on association. Intervention in medicine 
      is about the causal effects. The average treatment effect has long been studied 
      as a measure of causal effect, assuming that all populations have the same effect 
      size. However, no "one-size-fits-all" treatment seems to work in some complex 
      diseases. Treatment effects may vary by patient. Estimating heterogeneous 
      treatment effects (HTE) may have a high impact on developing personalized 
      treatment. Lots of advanced machine learning models for estimating HTE have 
      emerged in recent years, but there has been limited translational research into 
      the real-world healthcare domain. To fill the gap, we reviewed and compared 
      eleven recent HTE estimation methodologies, including meta-learner, 
      representation learning models, and tree-based models. We performed a 
      comprehensive benchmark experiment based on nationwide healthcare claim data with 
      application to Alzheimer's disease drug repurposing. We provided some challenges 
      and opportunities in HTE estimation analysis in the healthcare domain to close 
      the gap between innovative HTE models and deployment to real-world healthcare 
      problems.

TI  - System level modeling and analysis of TNF-α mediated sphingolipid signaling 
      pathway in neurological disorders for the prediction of therapeutic targets.

AB  - Sphingomyelin (SM) belongs to a class of lipids termed sphingolipids. The 
      disruption in the sphingomyelin signaling pathway is associated with various 
      neurodegenerative disorders. TNF-α, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine generated 
      in response to various neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS), is an eminent regulator of 
      the sphingomyelin metabolic pathway. The immune-triggered regulation of the 
      sphingomyelin metabolic pathway via TNF-α constitutes the sphingomyelin signaling 
      pathway. In this pathway, sphingomyelin and its downstream sphingolipids activate 
      various signaling cascades like PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, thus, controlling 
      diverse processes coupled with neuronal viability, survival, and death. The 
      holistic analysis of the immune-triggered sphingomyelin signaling pathway is 
      imperative to make necessary predictions about its pivotal components and for the 
      formulation of disease-related therapeutics. The current work offers a 
      comprehensive in silico systems analysis of TNF-α mediated sphingomyelin and 
      downstream signaling cascades via a model-based quantitative approach. We 
      incorporated the intensity values of genes from the microarray data of control 
      individuals from the AD study in the input entities of the pathway model. 
      Computational modeling and simulation of the inflammatory pathway enabled the 
      comprehensive study of the system dynamics. Network and sensitivity analysis of 
      the model unveiled essential interaction parameters and entities during 
      neuroinflammation. Scanning of the key entities and parameters allowed us to 
      determine their ultimate impact on neuronal apoptosis and survival. Moreover, the 
      efficacy and potency of the FDA-approved drugs, namely Etanercept, Nivocasan, and 
      Scyphostatin allowed us to study the model's response towards inhibition of the 
      respective proteins/enzymes. The network analysis revealed the pivotal model 
      entities with high betweenness and closeness centrality values including recruit 
      FADD, TNFR_TRADD, act CASP2, actCASP8, actCASP3 and 9, cytochrome C, and 
      RIP_RAIDD which profoundly impacted the neuronal apoptosis. Whereas some of the 
      entities with high betweenness and closeness centrality values like Gi-coupled 
      receptor, actS1PR, Sphingosine, S1P, actAKT, and actERK produced a high influence 
      on neuronal survival. However, the current study inferred the dual role of 
      ceramide, both on neuronal survival and apoptosis. Moreover, the drug Nivocasan 
      effectively reduces neuronal apoptosis via its inhibitory mechanism on the 
      caspases.

AB  - We evaluated the hypothesis that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, including 
      sildenafil and tadalafil, may be associated with reduced incidence of Alzheimer's 
      disease and related dementia using a patient-level cohort study of Medicare 
      claims and cell culture-based phenotypic assays. We compared incidence of 
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementia after phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor 
      initiation versus endothelin receptor antagonist initiation among patients with 
      pulmonary hypertension after controlling for 76 confounding variables through 
      propensity score matching. Across four separate analytic approaches designed to 
      address specific types of biases including informative censoring, reverse 
      causality, and outcome misclassification, we observed no evidence for a reduced 
      risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia with phosphodiesterase-5 
      inhibitors;hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.99 (0.69-1.43), 1.00 
      (0.71-1.42), 0.67 (0.43-1.06), and 1.15 (0.57-2.34). We also did not observe 
      evidence that sildenafil ameliorated molecular abnormalities relevant to 
      Alzheimer's disease in most cell culture-based phenotypic assays. These results 
      do not provide support to the hypothesis that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are 
      promising repurposing candidates for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and 
      dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) together account for the vast majority of 
      individuals with dementia. Approximately 35 million people worldwide are affected 
      with this condition, and despite decades of research, effective therapies that 
      slow or reverse disease progression have not yet been developed. The recent 
      failure of several large-scale clinical trials is beginning to challenge the 
      magnitude of focus on amyloid-related therapies for AD, and newer drug targets 
      that have shown promise in the laboratory are being investigated in clinical 
      trials. AREAS COVERED: This review summarises the current understanding of the 
      underlying biology of AD, PDD and DLB and outlines the most recent drug 
      candidates in advanced clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION: The lack of success in 
      drug discovery for disease-modifying therapies for AD, PDD and DLB can be 
      attributed to limitations in the design of clinical trials and the narrow focus 
      of molecular targets for treatment. New avenues for drug discovery including 
      repositioning and novel target identification may now provide opportunities for 
      success, provided a critical mass of clinical trials is achieved through 
      increased investment.

AB  - Drug repurposing can accelerate drug development while reducing the cost and risk 
      of toxicity typically associated with de novo drug design. Several disorders 
      lacking pharmacological solutions and exhibiting poor results in clinical trials 
      - such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) - could benefit from a cost-effective approach 
      to finding new therapeutics. We previously developed a neural network model, 
      Z-LaP Tracker, capable of quantifying behaviors in zebrafish larvae relevant to 
      cognitive function, including activity, reactivity, swimming patterns, and 
      optomotor response in the presence of visual and acoustic stimuli. Using this 
      model, we performed a high-throughput screening of FDA-approved drugs to identify 
      compounds that affect zebrafish larval behavior in a manner consistent with the 
      distinct behavior induced by calcineurin inhibitors. Cyclosporine (CsA) and other 
      calcineurin inhibitors have garnered interest for their potential role in the 
      prevention of AD. We generated behavioral profiles suitable for cluster analysis, 
      through which we identified 64 candidate therapeutics for neurodegenerative 
      disorders.

PG  - 98

LID - 98
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatments are needed to address the growing prevalence of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical trials have failed to produce any AD drugs for 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval since 2003, and the pharmaceutical 
      development process is both time-consuming and costly. Drug repurposing provides 
      an opportunity to accelerate this process by investigating the AD-related effects 
      of agents approved for other indications. These drugs have known safety profiles, 
      pharmacokinetic characterization, formulations, doses, and manufacturing 
      processes. METHODS: We assessed repurposed AD therapies represented in Phase I, 
      Phase II, and Phase III of the current AD pipeline as registered on 
      ClinicalTrials.gov as of February 27, 2020. RESULTS: We identified 53 clinical 
      trials involving 58 FDA-approved agents. Seventy-eight percent of the agents in 
      trials had putative disease-modifying mechanisms of action. Of the repurposed 
      drugs in the pipeline 20% are hematologic-oncologic agents, 18% are drugs derived 
      from cardiovascular indications, 14% are agents with psychiatric uses, 12% are 
      drug used to treat diabetes, 10% are neurologic agents, and the remaining 26% of 
      drugs fall under other conditions. Intellectual property strategies utilized in 
      these programs included using the same drug but altering doses, routes of 
      administration, or formulations. Most repurposing trials were supported by 
      Academic Medical Centers and were not funded through the biopharmaceutical 
      industry. We compared our results to a European trial registry and found results 
      similar to those derived from ClinicalTrials.gov. CONCLUSIONS: Drug repurposing 
      is a common approach to AD drug development and represents 39% of trials in the 
      current AD pipeline. Therapies from many disease areas provide agents potentially 
      useful in AD. Most of the repurposed agents are generic and a variety of 
      intellectual property strategies have been adopted to enhance their economic 
      value.

AB  - Increasing human life expectancy prompts the development of novel remedies for 
      cognitive decline: 44 million people worldwide are affected by dementia, and this 
      number is predicted to triple by 2050. Acetylcholinesterase and 
      N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors represent the targets of currently available drugs 
      for Alzheimer's disease, which are characterized by limited efficacy. Thus, the 
      search for therapeutic agents with alternative or combined mechanisms of action 
      is wide open. Since variations in 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate, 
      3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate, and/or nitric oxide levels interfere with 
      downstream pathways involved in memory processes, evidence supporting the 
      potential of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors in contrasting neurodegeneration 
      should be critically considered. For the preparation of this Review, more than 
      140 scientific papers were retrieved by searching PubMed and Scopus databases. A 
      systematic approach was adopted when overviewing the different PDE isoforms, 
      taking into account details on brain localization, downstream molecular 
      mechanisms, and inhibitors currently under study, according to available in vitro 
      and in vivo data. In the context of drug repurposing, a section focusing on PDE5 
      was introduced. Original computational studies were performed to rationalize the 
      emerging evidence that suggests the role of PDE5 inhibitors as multi-target 
      agents against neurodegeneration. Moreover, since such compounds must cross the 
      blood-brain barrier and reach inhibitory concentrations in the central nervous 
      system to exert their therapeutic activity, physicochemical parameters were 
      analyzed and discussed. Taken together, literature and computational data suggest 
      that some PDE5 inhibitors, such as tadalafil, represent promising candidates.

AB  - The quest for neuroprotective drugs to slow the progression of neurodegenerative 
      diseases (NDDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), 
      and Huntington's disease (HD), has been largely unrewarding. Preclinical evidence 
      suggests that repurposing quetiapine, lithium, valproate, fluoxetine, donepezil, 
      and memantine for early and pre-symptomatic disease-modification in NDDs may be 
      promising and can spare regulatory barriers. The literature of these 
      psychotropics in early stage and pre-symptomatic AD, PD, and HD is reviewed and 
      propitious findings follow. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase of AD: salutary 
      human randomized controlled trial findings for low-dose lithium and, in selected 
      patients, donepezil await replication. Pre-symptomatic AD: human epidemiological 
      data indicate that lithium reduces AD risk. Animal model studies (AMS) reveal 
      encouraging results for quetiapine, lithium, donepezil, and memantine. Early PD: 
      valproate AMS findings show promise. Pre-symptomatic PD: lithium and valproate 
      AMS findings are encouraging. Early HD: uncontrolled clinical data indicate 
      non-progression with lithium, fluoxetine, donepezil, and memantine. 
      Pre-symptomatic HD: lithium and valproate are auspicious in AMS. Many other 
      promising findings awaiting replication (valproate in MCI; lithium, valproate, 
      fluoxetine in pre-symptomatic AD; lithium in early PD; lithium, valproate, 
      fluoxetine in pre-symptomatic PD; donepezil in early HD; lithium, fluoxetine, 
      memantine in pre-symptomatic HD) are reviewed. Dose- and stage-dependent effects 
      are considered. Suggestions for signal-enhancement in human trials are provided 
      for each NDD stage.

AB  - Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has long been viewed as a precious source of 
      modern drug discovery. AI-assisted drug discovery (AIDD) has been investigated 
      extensively. However, there are still two challenges in applying AIDD to guide 
      TCM drug discovery: the lack of a large amount of standardized TCM-related 
      information and AIDD is prone to pathological failures in out-of-domain data. We 
      have released TCM Database@Taiwan in 2011, and it has been widely disseminated 
      and used. Now, we developed TCMBank, the largest systematic free TCM database, 
      which is an extension of TCM Database@Taiwan. TCMBank contains 9192 herbs, 61 966 
      ingredients (unduplicated), 15 179 targets, 32 529 diseases, and their pairwise 
      relationships. By integrating multiple data sources, TCMBank provides 3D 
      structure information of ingredients and provides a standard list and detailed 
      information on herbs, ingredients, targets and diseases. TCMBank has an 
      intelligent document identification module that continuously adds TCM-related 
      information retrieved from the literature in PubChem. In addition, driven by 
      TCMBank big data, we developed an ensemble learning-based drug discovery protocol 
      for identifying potential leads and drug repurposing. We take colorectal cancer 
      and Alzheimer's disease as examples to demonstrate how to accelerate drug 
      discovery by artificial intelligence. Using TCMBank, researchers can view 
      literature-driven relationship mapping between herbs/ingredients and 
      genes/diseases, allowing the understanding of molecular action mechanisms for 
      ingredients and identification of new potentially effective treatments. TCMBank 
      is available at https://TCMBank.CN/.

AB  - Computational drug repositioning, designed to identify new indications for 
      existing drugs, significantly reduced the cost and time involved in drug 
      development. Prediction of drug-disease associations is promising for drug 
      repositioning. Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of machine 
      learning-based methods for calculating drug repositioning. In this paper, a novel 
      feature learning method based on Gaussian interaction profile kernel and 
      autoencoder (GIPAE) is proposed for drug-disease association. In order to further 
      reduce the computation cost, both batch normalization layer and the 
      full-connected layer are introduced to reduce training complexity. The 
      experimental results of 10-fold cross validation indicate that the proposed 
      method achieves superior performance on Fdataset and Cdataset with the AUCs of 
      93.30% and 96.03%, respectively, which were higher than many previous 
      computational models. To further assess the accuracy of GIPAE, we conducted case 
      studies on two complex human diseases. The top 20 drugs predicted, 14 
      obesity-related drugs, and 11 drugs related to Alzheimer's disease were validated 
      in the CTD database. The results of cross validation and case studies indicated 
      that GIPAE is a reliable model for predicting drug-disease associations.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has affected 
      millions of people worldwide. However, currently, there is no treatment to cure 
      the disease. The AD drugs available in the market only manage the disease 
      symptomatically and the effects are usually short-term. Thus, there is a need to 
      look at alternatives AD therapies. This literature review aims to shed some light 
      on the potential of repurposing antihypertensives to treat AD. Mid-life 
      hypertension has not only been recognised as a risk factor for AD, but its 
      relation with AD has also been well established. Hence, antihypertensives were 
      postulated to be beneficial in managing AD. Four classes of antihypertensives, as 
      well as their potential limitations and prospects in being utilised as AD 
      therapeutics, were discussed in this review.

AB  - Drug repurposing, also referred to as drug repositioning or drug reprofiling, is 
      a scientific approach to the detection of any new application for an already 
      approved or investigational drug. It is a useful policy for the invention and 
      development of new pharmacological or therapeutic applications of different 
      drugs. The strategy has been known to offer numerous advantages over developing a 
      completely novel drug for certain problems. Drug repurposing has numerous 
      methodologies that can be categorized as target-oriented, drug-oriented, and 
      problem-oriented. The choice of the methodology of drug repurposing relies on the 
      accessible information about the drug molecule and like pharmacokinetic, 
      pharmacological, physicochemical, and toxicological profile of the drug. In 
      addition, molecular docking studies and other computer-aided methods have been 
      known to show application in drug repurposing. The variation in dosage for 
      original target diseases and novel diseases presents a challenge for researchers 
      of drug repurposing in present times. The present review critically discusses the 
      drugs repurposed for cancer, covid-19, Alzheimer's, and other diseases, 
      strategies, and challenges of drug repurposing. Moreover, regulatory perspectives 
      related to different countries like the United States (US), Europe, and India 
      have been delineated in the present review.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no 
      conclusive remedy. Yohimbine, found in Rauwolfia vomitoria, may reduce brain 
      inflammation by targeting tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), implicated in AD 
      pathogenesis. Metoserpate, a synthetic compound, may inhibit TNFα. The study is 
      aimed at assessing the potential utility of repurposing metoserpate for TNFα 
      inhibition to reduce neuronal damage and inflammation in AD. The development of 
      safe and effective treatments for AD is crucial to address the growing burden of 
      the disease, which is projected to double over the next two decades. METHODS: Our 
      study repurposed an FDA-approved drug as TNFα inhibitor for AD management using 
      structural similarity studies, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics 
      simulations. Yohimbine was used as a reference compound. Molecular docking used 
      SeeSAR, and molecular dynamics simulation used GROMACS. RESULTS: Metoserpate was 
      selected from 10 compounds similar to yohimbine based on pharmacokinetic 
      properties and FDA approval status. Molecular docking and simulation studies 
      showed a stable interaction between metoserpate and TNFα over 100 ns (100000 ps). 
      This suggests a reliable and robust interaction between the protein and ligand, 
      supporting the potential utility of repurposing metoserpate for TNFα inhibition 
      in AD treatment. CONCLUSION: Our study has identified metoserpate, a previously 
      FDA-approved antihypertensive agent, as a promising candidate for inhibiting TNFα 
      in the management of AD.

TI  - Old Drugs as New Treatments for Neurodegenerative Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/ph11020044 [doi]
LID - 44
AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are increasing in number, given that the general 
      global population is becoming older. They manifest themselves through mechanisms 
      that are not fully understood, in many cases, and impair memory, cognition and 
      movement. Currently, no neurodegenerative disease is curable, and the treatments 
      available only manage the symptoms or halt the progression of the disease. 
      Therefore, there is an urgent need for new treatments for this kind of disease, 
      since the World Health Organization has predicted that neurodegenerative diseases 
      affecting motor function will become the second-most prevalent cause of death in 
      the next 20 years. New therapies can come from three main sources: synthesis, 
      natural products, and existing drugs. This last source is known as drug 
      repurposing, which is the most advantageous, since the drug&rsquo;s 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are already established, and the 
      investment put into this strategy is not as significant as for the classic 
      development of new drugs. There have been several studies on the potential of old 
      drugs for the most relevant neurodegenerative diseases, including 
      Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, Huntington&rsquo;s disease, 
      Multiple Sclerosis and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

AB  - Innate immune system activation and inflammation are associated with and may 
      contribute to clinical outcomes in people with Down syndrome (DS), 
      neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and normal aging. In 
      addition to serving as potential diagnostic biomarkers, innate immune system 
      activation and inflammation may play a contributing or causal role in these 
      conditions, leading to the hypothesis that effective therapies should seek to 
      dampen their effects. However, recent intervention studies with the innate immune 
      system activator granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in 
      animal models of DS, AD, and normal aging, and in an AD clinical trial suggest 
      that activating the innate immune system and inflammation may instead be 
      therapeutic. We consider evidence that DS, AD, and normal aging are accompanied 
      by innate immune system activation and inflammation and discuss whether and when 
      during the disease process it may be therapeutically beneficial to suppress or 
      promote such activation.

      the onset and prevent progression of Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 932-960
LID - 10.1007/s12272-020-01268-5 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder. 
      As with other common chronic diseases, multiple risk factors contribute to the 
      onset and progression of AD. Many researchers have evaluated the epidemiologic 
      and pathophysiological association between AD, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), 
      and cerebrovascular diseases (CBVDs), including commonly reported risk factors 
      such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Relevant therapies of 
      CVDs/CBVDs for the attenuation of AD have also been empirically investigated. 
      Considering the challenges of new drug development, in terms of cost and time, 
      multifactorial approaches such as therapeutic repositioning of CVD/CBVD 
      medication should be explored to delay the onset and progression of AD. Thus, in 
      this review, we discuss our current understanding of the association between 
      cardiovascular risk factors and AD, as revealed by clinical and non-clinical 
      studies, as well as the therapeutic implications of CVD/CBVD medication that may 
      attenuate AD. Furthermore, we discuss future directions by evaluating ongoing 
      trials in the field.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To integrate genome-wide association study data with 
      tissue-specific gene expression information to identify coexpression networks, 
      biological pathways, and drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer disease. 
      METHODS: We integrated genome-wide association summary statistics for Alzheimer 
      disease with tissue-specific gene coexpression networks from brain tissue samples 
      in the Genotype-Tissue Expression study. We identified gene coexpression networks 
      enriched with genetic signals for Alzheimer disease and characterized the 
      associated networks using biological pathway analysis. The disease-implicated 
      modules were subsequently used as a molecular substrate for a computational drug 
      repositioning analysis, in which we (1) imputed genetically regulated gene 
      expression within Alzheimer disease implicated modules; (2) integrated the 
      imputed gene expression levels with drug-gene signatures from the connectivity 
      map to identify compounds that normalize dysregulated gene expression underlying 
      Alzheimer disease; and (3) prioritized drug compounds and mechanisms of action 
      based on the extent to which they normalize dysregulated expression signatures. 
      RESULTS: Genetic factors for Alzheimer disease are enriched in brain gene 
      coexpression networks involved in the immune response. Computational drug 
      repositioning analyses of expression changes within the disease-associated 
      networks retrieved known Alzheimer disease drugs (e.g., memantine) as well as 
      biologically meaningful drug categories (e.g., glutamate receptor antagonists). 
      DISCUSSION: Our results improve the biological interpretation of genetic data for 
      Alzheimer disease and provide a list of potential antidementia drug repositioning 
      candidates for which the efficacy should be investigated in functional validation 
      studies.

AB  - Alarming epidemiological features of Alzheimer's disease impose curative 
      treatment rather than symptomatic relief. Drug repurposing, that is reappraisal 
      of a substance's indications against other diseases, offers time, cost and 
      efficiency benefits in drug development, especially when in silico techniques are 
      used. In this study, we have used gene signatures, where up- and down-regulated 
      gene lists summarize a cell's gene expression perturbation from a drug or 
      disease. To cope with the inherent biological and computational noise, we used an 
      integrative approach on five disease-related microarray data sets of hippocampal 
      origin with three different methods of evaluating differential gene expression 
      and four drug repurposing tools. We found a list of 27 potential anti-Alzheimer 
      agents that were additionally processed with regard to molecular similarity, 
      pathway/ontology enrichment and network analysis. Protein kinase C, histone 
      deacetylase, glycogen synthase kinase 3 and arginase inhibitors appear 
      consistently in the resultant drug list and may exert their pharmacologic action 
      in an epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated subpathway of Alzheimer's 
      disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the 
      central nervous system (CNS) leading to mental deterioration and devastation, and 
      eventually a fatal outcome. AD affects mostly the elderly. AD is frequently 
      accompanied by hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes 
      mellitus, and these are significant risk factors of AD. Other conditions 
      triggered by the progression of AD include psychosis, sleep disorders, epilepsy, 
      and depression. One important comorbidity is Down's syndrome, which directly 
      contributes to the severity and rapid progression of AD. The development of new 
      therapeutic strategies for AD includes the repurposing of drugs currently used 
      for the treatment of comorbidities. A better understanding of the influence of 
      comorbidities on the pathogenesis of AD, and the medications used in its 
      treatment, might allow better control of disease progression, and more effective 
      pharmacotherapy.

TI  - miR-132 regulates the expression of synaptic proteins in APP/PS1 transgenic mice 
      through C1q.

AB  - Cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually accompanied by 
      synaptic loss in both the hippocampus and neocortex. In the early stage of AD, 
      amyloid β-induced synapse changes is the main reason, while in the later stage, 
      the accumulation of Tau protein promotes synapse degeneration as the key factor 
      leading to dementia. MicroRNA (miRNA) is closely related to the expression 
      changes of many AD-related genes. One of the most abundant brain-enriched miRNAs 
      is miR-132, which has been shown to regulate both neuron morphogenesis and 
      plasticity. It has been reported that miR-132 is significantly reduced in the 
      brains of Alzheimer's patients. Genetic deletion of miR-132 in mice promotes Aβ 
      deposition, leading to impaired memory and enhanced Tau pathology, but how the 
      miRNA-mediated gene expression dysregulation contributes to AD pathology remains 
      unclear. Here we found the possible downstream target of miR-132 by in silico 
      analysis, namely C1q. C1q is the primary protein of classical complement cascade, 
      which is highly expressed in the synaptic regions of the central nervous system 
      in Alzheimer's patients. However, it is not clear whether miR-132 plays a role in 
      AD through regulating C1q. To address this question, the APP/PS1 transgenic mice 
      were transfected with miR-132 and given C1 inhibitors. Behavior tests were 
      conducted to assess memory and cognitive abilities seven days after 
      administration. In addition, we analyzed the expression of PSD95, Synapsin-1 and 
      phosphorylated (p)-Synapsin. We found that the expression levels of the synaptic 
      proteins treated with miR-132 or C1INH were significantly increased compared with 
      the AD group. Further RT-qPCR result suggested that miR-132 might regulate C1q 
      expression in AD.

TI  - Drug Repositioning of Pioglitazone in Management and Improving the Cognitive 
      Function among the Patients With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1132-1141
LID - 10.4103/0028-3886.391397 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disease-modifying agents like Pioglitazone have shown promising 
      effects on neuroinflammation and homeostasis of amyloid plaques, but there is a 
      lack of research papers providing conclusive evidence. OBJECTIVES: This study is 
      aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of Pioglitazone in improving cognitive 
      function in patients with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Trials published in the last 12 years were identified from PubMed, 
      Scopus, Cochrane Central, and other trial registries. Five hundred twenty-five 
      records were obtained, from which five studies were included for quantitative 
      analysis. Studies comparing Pioglitazone with a suitable placebo or other oral 
      hypoglycemic agent were considered for review. Data was extracted using a 
      pretested form, which was followed by a risk of bias assessment (ROB) with 
      Cochrane's ROB assessment tool. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included studies 
      where Pioglitazone (15-30 mg) was compared to other oral hypoglycemic agents, 
      placebo, or diabetic diet for a minimum duration of 6 months. Pioglitazone did 
      not show a statistically significant improvement in Alzheimer's Disease 
      Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores [mean difference (MD): 
      -1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI): -4.14-1.81]. By conducting sensitivity 
      analysis with the removal of one study, significant efficacy was obtained [MD: 
      -2.75; 95% CI: -4.84--0.66]. The Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised logical memory I 
      (WMS-R) scores had a significant improvement in the Pioglitazone group [MD: 2.02; 
      95% CI: 0.09-3.95]. CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone is a safe medication that has a 
      promising effect in slowing the advancement of AD.

TI  - Mood, stress and longevity: convergence on ANK3.
PG  - 1037-49
LID - 10.1038/mp.2016.65 [doi]
AB  - Antidepressants have been shown to improve longevity in C. elegans. It is 
      plausible that orthologs of genes involved in mood regulation and stress response 
      are involved in such an effect. We sought to understand the underlying biology. 
      First, we analyzed the transcriptome from worms treated with the antidepressant 
      mianserin, previously identified in a large-scale unbiased drug screen as 
      promoting increased lifespan in worms. We identified the most robust 
      treatment-related changes in gene expression, and identified the corresponding 
      human orthologs. Our analysis uncovered a series of genes and biological pathways 
      that may be at the interface between antidepressant effects and longevity, 
      notably pathways involved in drug metabolism/degradation (nicotine and 
      melatonin). Second, we examined which of these genes overlap with genes which may 
      be involved in depressive symptoms in an aging non-psychiatric human population 
      (n=3577), discovered using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach in a 
      design with extremes of distribution of phenotype. Third, we used a convergent 
      functional genomics (CFG) approach to prioritize these genes for relevance to 
      mood disorders and stress. The top gene identified was ANK3. To validate our 
      findings, we conducted genetic and gene-expression studies, in C. elegans and in 
      humans. We studied C. elegans inactivating mutants for ANK3/unc-44, and show that 
      they survive longer than wild-type, particularly in older worms, independently of 
      mianserin treatment. We also show that some ANK3/unc-44 expression is necessary 
      for the effects of mianserin on prolonging lifespan and survival in the face of 
      oxidative stress, particularly in younger worms. Wild-type ANK3/unc-44 increases 
      in expression with age in C. elegans, and is maintained at lower youthful levels 
      by mianserin treatment. These lower levels may be optimal in terms of longevity, 
      offering a favorable balance between sufficient oxidative stress resistance in 
      younger worms and survival effects in older worms. Thus, ANK3/unc-44 may 
      represent an example of antagonistic pleiotropy, in which low-expression level in 
      young animals are beneficial, but the age-associated increase becomes 
      detrimental. Inactivating mutations in ANK3/unc-44 reverse this effect and cause 
      detrimental effects in young animals (sensitivity to oxidative stress) and 
      beneficial effect in old animals (increased survival). In humans, we studied if 
      the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for depressive symptoms 
      in ANK3 from our GWAS has a relationship to lifespan, and show a trend towards 
      longer lifespan in individuals with the risk allele for depressive symptoms in 
      men (odds ratio (OR) 1.41, P=0.031) but not in women (OR 1.08, P=0.33). We also 
      examined whether ANK3, by itself or in a panel with other top CFG-prioritized 
      genes, acts as a blood gene-expression biomarker for biological age, in two 
      independent cohorts, one of live psychiatric patients (n=737), and one of suicide 
      completers from the coroner's office (n=45). We show significantly lower levels 
      of ANK3 expression in chronologically younger individuals than in middle age 
      individuals, with a diminution of that effect in suicide completers, who 
      presumably have been exposed to more severe and acute negative mood and stress. 
      Of note, ANK3 was previously reported to be overexpressed in fibroblasts from 
      patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a form of accelerated aging. 
      Taken together, these studies uncover ANK3 and other genes in our dataset as 
      biological links between mood, stress and longevity/aging, that may be biomarkers 
      as well as targets for preventive or therapeutic interventions. Drug repurposing 
      bioinformatics analyses identified the relatively innocuous omega-3 fatty acid 
      DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), piracetam, quercetin, vitamin D and resveratrol as 
      potential longevity promoting compounds, along with a series of existing drugs, 
      such as estrogen-like compounds, antidiabetics and sirolimus/rapamycin. 
      Intriguingly, some of our top candidate genes for mood and stress-modulated 
      longevity were changed in expression in opposite direction in previous studies in 
      the Alzheimer disease. Additionally, a whole series of others were changed in 
      expression in opposite direction in our previous studies on suicide, suggesting 
      the possibility of a "life switch" actively controlled by mood and stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial and complex 
      neuropathology that involves impairment of many intricate molecular mechanisms. 
      Despite recent advances, AD pathophysiological characterization remains 
      incomplete, which hampers the development of effective treatments. In fact, 
      currently, there are no effective pharmacological treatments for AD. Integrative 
      strategies such as transcription regulatory network and master regulator analyses 
      exemplify promising new approaches to study complex diseases and may help in the 
      identification of potential pharmacological targets. METHODS: In this study, we 
      used transcription regulatory network and master regulator analyses on 
      transcriptomic data of human hippocampus to identify transcription factors (TFs) 
      that can potentially act as master regulators in AD. All expression profiles were 
      obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database using the GEOquery package. A 
      normal hippocampus transcription factor-centered regulatory network was 
      reconstructed using the ARACNe algorithm. Master regulator analysis and two-tail 
      gene set enrichment analysis were employed to evaluate the inferred regulatory 
      units in AD case-control studies. Finally, we used a connectivity map adaptation 
      to prospect new potential therapeutic interventions by drug repurposing. RESULTS: 
      We identified TFs with already reported involvement in AD, such as ATF2 and 
      PARK2, as well as possible new targets for future investigations, such as CNOT7, 
      CSRNP2, SLC30A9, and TSC22D1. Furthermore, Connectivity Map Analysis adaptation 
      suggested the repositioning of six FDA-approved drugs that can potentially 
      modulate master regulator candidate regulatory units (Cefuroxime, Cyproterone, 
      Dydrogesterone, Metrizamide, Trimethadione, and Vorinostat). CONCLUSIONS: Using a 
      transcription factor-centered regulatory network reconstruction we were able to 
      identify several potential molecular targets and six drug candidates for 
      repositioning in AD. Our study provides further support for the use of 
      bioinformatics tools as exploratory strategies in neurodegenerative diseases 
      research, and also provides new perspectives on molecular targets and drug 
      therapies for future investigation and validation in AD.

TI  - Re-engineering a neuroprotective, clinical drug as a procognitive agent with high 
      in vivo potency and with GABAA potentiating activity for use in dementia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Synaptic dysfunction is a key event in pathogenesis of 
      neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) where synapse loss 
      pathologically correlates with cognitive decline and dementia. Although evidence 
      suggests that aberrant protein production and aggregation are the causative 
      factors in familial subsets of such diseases, drugs singularly targeting these 
      hallmark proteins, such as amyloid-β, have failed in late stage clinical trials. 
      Therefore, to provide a successful disease-modifying compound and address 
      synaptic dysfunction and memory loss in AD and mixed pathology dementia, we 
      repurposed a clinically proven drug, CMZ, with neuroprotective and 
      anti-inflammatory properties via addition of nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP signaling 
      property. RESULTS: The novel compound, NMZ, was shown to retain the GABAA 
      potentiating actions of CMZ in vitro and sedative activity in vivo. Importantly, 
      NMZ restored LTP in hippocampal slices from AD transgenic mice, whereas CMZ was 
      without effect. NMZ reversed amnestic blockade of acetylcholine receptors by 
      scopolamine as well as NMDA receptor blockade by a benzodiazepine and a NO 
      synthase inhibitor in the step-through passive avoidance (STPA) test of learning 
      and working memory. A PK/PD relationship was developed based on STPA analysis 
      coupled with pharmacokinetic measures of drug levels in the brain: at 1 nM 
      concentration in brain and plasma, NMZ was able to restore memory consolidation 
      in mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that NMZ embodies a promising 
      pharmacological approach targeting synaptic dysfunction and opens new avenues for 
      neuroprotective intervention strategies in mixed pathology AD, neurodegeneration, 
      and dementia.

AB  - Developing drugs for treating Alzheimer's disease has been extremely challenging 
      and costly due to limited knowledge of underlying mechanisms and therapeutic 
      targets. To address the challenge in AD drug development, we developed a 
      multi-task deep learning pipeline that learns biological interactions and AD risk 
      genes, then utilizes multi-level evidence on drug efficacy to identify 
      repurposable drug candidates. Using the embedding derived from the model, we 
      ranked drug candidates based on evidence from post-treatment transcriptomic 
      patterns, efficacy in preclinical models, population-based treatment effects, and 
      clinical trials. We mechanistically validated the top-ranked candidates in 
      neuronal cells, identifying drug combinations with efficacy in reducing oxidative 
      stress and safety in maintaining neuronal viability and morphology. Our neuronal 
      response experiments confirmed several biologically efficacious drug 
      combinations. This pipeline showed that harmonizing heterogeneous and 
      complementary data/knowledge, including human interactome, transcriptome 
      patterns, experimental efficacy, and real-world patient data shed light on the 
      drug development of complex diseases.

TI  - A Functional Pipeline of Genome-Wide Association Data Leads to Midostaurin as a 
      Repurposed Drug for Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) constitute a powerful tool to identify the 
      different biochemical pathways associated with disease. This knowledge can be 
      used to prioritize drugs targeting these routes, paving the road to clinical 
      application. Here, we describe DAGGER (Drug Repositioning by Analysis of GWAS and 
      Gene Expression in R), a straightforward pipeline to find currently approved 
      drugs with repurposing potential. As a proof of concept, we analyzed a meta-GWAS 
      of 1.6 × 10(7) single-nucleotide polymorphisms performed on Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). Our pipeline uses the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and Drug Gene 
      Interaction (DGI) databases for a rational prioritization of 22 druggable 
      targets. Next, we performed a two-stage in vivo functional assay. We used a C. 
      elegans humanized model over-expressing the Aβ(1-42) peptide. We assayed the five 
      top-scoring candidate drugs, finding midostaurin, a multitarget protein kinase 
      inhibitor, to be a protective drug. Next, 3xTg AD transgenic mice were used for a 
      final evaluation of midostaurin's effect. Behavioral testing after three weeks of 
      20 mg/kg intraperitoneal treatment revealed a significant improvement in 
      behavior, including locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, and new-place recognition. 
      Altogether, we consider that our pipeline might be a useful tool for drug 
      repurposing in complex diseases.

      pipelines against Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
PG  - 110-113
LID - 10.1515/mr-2021-0017 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) affects more than 50 million 
      people worldwide but there is no clear therapeutic option affordable for the 
      general patient population. Recently, drug repositioning studies featuring 
      collaborations between academic institutes, medical centers, and hospitals are 
      generating novel therapeutics candidates against these devastating diseases and 
      filling in an important area for healthcare that is poorly represented by 
      pharmaceutical companies. Such drug repositioning studies converge expertise from 
      bioinformatics, chemical informatics, medical informatics, artificial 
      intelligence, high throughput and high-content screening and systems biology. 
      They also take advantage of multi-scale, multi-modality datasets, ranging from 
      transcriptomic and proteomic data, electronical medical records, and medical 
      imaging to social media information of patient behaviors and emotions and 
      epidemiology profiles of disease populations, in order to gain comprehensive 
      understanding of disease mechanisms and drug effects. We proposed a recursive 
      drug repositioning paradigm involving the iteration of three processing steps of 
      modeling, prediction, and validation to identify known drugs and bioactive 
      compounds for AD/ADRD. This recursive paradigm has the potential of quickly 
      obtaining a panel of robust novel drug candidates for AD/ADRD and gaining 
      in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms from those repositioned drug 
      candidates, subsequently improving the success rate of predicting novel hits.

TI  - Robust Sampling of Defective Pathways in Alzheimer's Disease. Implications in 
      Drug Repositioning.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21103594 [doi]
LID - 3594
AB  - We present the analysis of the defective genetic pathways of the Late-Onset 
      Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) compared to the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 
      Healthy Controls (HC) using different sampling methodologies. These algorithms 
      sample the uncertainty space that is intrinsic to any kind of highly 
      underdetermined phenotype prediction problem, by looking for the minimum-scale 
      signatures (header genes) corresponding to different random holdouts. The 
      biological pathways can be identified performing posterior analysis of these 
      signatures established via cross-validation holdouts and plugging the set of most 
      frequently sampled genes into different ontological platforms. That way, the 
      effect of helper genes, whose presence might be due to the high degree of under 
      determinacy of these experiments and data noise, is reduced. Our results suggest 
      that common pathways for Alzheimer's disease and MCI are mainly related to viral 
      mRNA translation, influenza viral RNA transcription and replication, gene 
      expression, mitochondrial translation, and metabolism, with these results being 
      highly consistent regardless of the comparative methods. The cross-validated 
      predictive accuracies achieved for the LOAD and MCI discriminations were 84% and 
      81.5%, respectively. The difference between LOAD and MCI could not be clearly 
      established (74% accuracy). The most discriminatory genes of the LOAD-MCI 
      discrimination are associated with proteasome mediated degradation and G-protein 
      signaling. Based on these findings we have also performed drug repositioning 
      using Dr. Insight package, proposing the following different typologies of drugs: 
      isoquinoline alkaloids, antitumor antibiotics, phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3K, 
      autophagy inhibitors, antagonists of the&nbsp;muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 
      and histone deacetylase inhibitors. We believe that the potential clinical 
      relevance of these findings should be further investigated and confirmed with 
      other independent studies.

      potential inhibitor of caspase-1 activation.
PG  - 1310-1318
LID - 10.1007/s10495-017-1405-z [doi]
AB  - Inflammasomes are intracellular multiprotein complexes of the innate immune 
      system. Upon an inflammatory insult, such as infection or intracellular damage, a 
      nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) sensor protein and 
      the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a 
      caspase activation and recruitment domain) are assembled to activate protease 
      procaspase-1. This protease processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 cytokines, which 
      are released to induce the inflammatory response. De-regulation of inflammasome 
      contributes to the progression of several diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, 
      diabetes, cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. We herein describe the 
      identification of methylergometrine (MEM), a drug currently used as a smooth 
      muscle constrictor during postpartum hemorrhage, as an inhibitor of the 
      inflammasome complex in ASC-mediated procaspase-1 activation screening. MEM 
      inhibits the activation of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like 
      receptor protein 1 (NLRP1) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like 
      receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes in cellular models upon different 
      pro-inflammatory stimuli. Our results suggest that MEM has the potential to 
      reposition in the treatment of inflammatory diseases with the advantages of 
      established safety and clinical data.

      disease.
PG  - 1304-21
LID - 10.3390/ph6101304 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting 
      approximately two thirds of the 35 million people worldwide with the condition. 
      Despite this, effective treatments are lacking, and there are no drugs that 
      elicit disease modifying effects to improve outcome. There is an urgent need to 
      develop and evaluate more effective pharmacological treatments. Drug 
      repositioning offers an exciting opportunity to repurpose existing licensed 
      treatments for use in AD, with the benefit of providing a far more rapid route to 
      the clinic than through novel drug discovery approaches. This review outlines the 
      current most promising candidates for repositioning in AD, their supporting 
      evidence and their progress through trials to date. Furthermore, it begins to 
      explore the potential of new transcriptomic and microarray techniques to consider 
      the future of drug repositioning as a viable approach to drug discovery.

AB  - Given the continual increase in the number of patients and the lack of curative 
      treatment, the development of new therapies to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
      becoming ever more urgent. In this review, we summarize the most promising 
      preclinical studies in, and the significant benefits offered by, nanocarriers to 
      realize the full potential of marketed drugs and identify repurposed drugs. No 
      clinical trials have yet been conducted on nanocarriers for drug repurposing in 
      AD. However, recent preclinical results suggest that nanocarriers could overcome 
      the bioavailability and/or selectivity issues of repurposed drugs, improving 
      their therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Combination of Drugs and Cell Transplantation: More Beneficial Stem Cell-Based 
      Regenerative Therapies Targeting Neurological Disorders.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22169047 [doi]
LID - 9047
AB  - Cell transplantation therapy using pluripotent/multipotent stem cells has gained 
      attention as a novel therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative 
      diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's 
      disease, ischemic stroke, and spinal cord injury. To fully realize the potential 
      of cell transplantation therapy, new therapeutic options that increase cell 
      engraftments must be developed, either through modifications to the grafted cells 
      themselves or through changes in the microenvironment surrounding the grafted 
      region. Together these developments could potentially restore lost neuronal 
      function by better supporting grafted cells. In addition, drug administration can 
      improve the outcome of cell transplantation therapy through better accessibility 
      and delivery to the target region following cell transplantation. Here we 
      introduce examples of drug repurposing approaches for more successful 
      transplantation therapies based on preclinical experiments with clinically 
      approved drugs. Drug repurposing is an advantageous drug development strategy 
      because drugs that have already been clinically approved can be repurposed to 
      treat other diseases faster and at lower cost. Therefore, drug repurposing is a 
      reasonable approach to enhance the outcomes of cell transplantation therapies for 
      neurological diseases. Ideal repurposing candidates would result in more 
      efficient cell transplantation therapies and provide a new and beneficial 
      therapeutic combination.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a complex disorder encompassing multiple pathological 
      features with associated genetic and molecular culprits. However, target-based 
      therapeutic strategies have so far proved ineffective. The aim of this study is 
      to develop a methodology harnessing the transcriptional changes associated with 
      Alzheimer's disease to develop a high content quantitative disease phenotype that 
      can be used to repurpose existing drugs. Firstly, the Alzheimer's disease gene 
      expression landscape covering severe disease stage, early pathology progression, 
      cognitive decline and animal models of the disease has been defined and used to 
      select a set of 153 drugs tending to oppose disease-associated changes in the 
      context of immortalised human cancer cell lines. The selected compounds have then 
      been assayed in the more biologically relevant setting of iPSC-derived cortical 
      neuron cultures. It is shown that 51 of the drugs drive expression changes 
      consistently opposite to those seen in Alzheimer's disease. It is hoped that the 
      iPSC profiles will serve as a useful resource for drug repositioning within the 
      context of neurodegenerative disease and potentially aid in generating novel 
      multi-targeted therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes 
      problems with memory, thinking, and behavior. Currently, there is no drug that 
      can reduce the pathological events of this degenerative disease but symptomatic 
      relief is possible that can abate the disease condition. N-methyl-D-aspartate 
      (NMDA) receptors exert a critical role for synaptic plasticity as well as 
      transmission. Overstimulation of glutamate receptors, predominantly NMDA type, 
      may cause excitotoxic effects on neurons and is recommended as a mechanism for 
      neurodegeneration. Atypical activation of the NMDA receptor has been suggested 
      for AD by synaptic dysfunction. NMDA receptor antagonists especially memantine 
      block the NMDA receptor and can reduce the influx of calcium (Ca2+) ions into 
      neuron, thus, toxic intracellular events are not activated. This review 
      represents the role of NMDA receptors antagonists as potential therapeutic agents 
      to reduce AD. Moreover, this review highlights the repositioning of memantine as 
      a potential novel therapeutic multitargeting agent for AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease 
      worldwide, with one in nine people over the age of 65 living with the disease in 
      2023. In this study, we used a phenome wide association study (PheWAS) approach 
      to identify cross-phenotype associations between previously identified genetic AD 
      and for electronic health record (EHR) diagnoses from the UK Biobank (UKBB) 
      (n=361,194 of European ancestry) and the eMERGE Network (n=105,108 of diverse 
      ancestry). Based on 497 previously identified AD-associated variants from the 
      Alzheimer's Disease Variant Portal (ADVP), we found significant associations 
      primarily in immune and cardiac related diseases in our PheWAS. Replicating 
      variants have widespread impacts on immune genes in diverse tissue types. This 
      study demonstrates the potential of using the PheWAS strategy to improve our 
      understanding of AD progression as well as identify potential drug repurposing 
      opportunities for new treatment and disease prevention strategies.

TI  - Repurposing radiotracers for myelin imaging: a study comparing 18F-florbetaben, 
      18F-florbetapir, 18F-flutemetamol,11C-MeDAS, and 11C-PiB.

AB  - PURPOSE: Drugs promoting myelin repair represent a promising therapeutic approach 
      in multiple sclerosis and several candidate molecules are currently being 
      evaluated, fostering the need of a quantitative method to specifically measure 
      myelin content in vivo. PET using the benzothiazole derivative (11)C-PiB has been 
      successfully used to quantify myelin content changes in humans. Stilbene 
      derivatives, such as (11)C-MeDAS, have also been shown to bind to myelin in 
      animals and are considered a promising radiopharmaceutical class for myelin 
      imaging. Fluorinated compounds from both classes are now commercially available 
      and thus should constitute clinically useful myelin radiotracers. The aim of this 
      study is to provide a head-to-head comparison of (18)F-florbetaben, 
      (18)F-florbetapir, (18)F-flutemetamol, (11)C-MeDAS, and (11)C-PiB with regard to 
      brain kinetics and binding in white matter (WM). METHODS: Four baboons underwent 
      a 90-min dynamic PET scan for each radioligand. Arterial blood samples were 
      collected during the exam for each radiotracer, except for (18)F-florbetapir, to 
      obtain a radiometabolite-corrected input function. Standardized uptake value 
      ratio between 75 at 90 min (SUVR(75-90)), binding potential (BP) estimated with 
      Logan method with input function, and distribution volume ratio (DVR) estimated 
      with Logan reference method (using cerebellar gray matter as reference region) 
      were calculated in WM and compared between tracers using mixed effect models. 
      RESULTS: In WM, (18)F-florbetapir had the highest SUVR(75-90) (1.38 ± 0.03), 
      followed by (18)F-flutemetamol (1.34 ± 0.02), (18)F-florbetaben (1.32 ± 0.07), 
      (11)C-MeDAS (1.27 ± 0.04), and (11)C-PiB (1.25 ± 0.07). With regard to BP, 
      (18)F-florbetaben had the highest value (0.32 ± 0.06) compared with 
      (18)F-flutemetamol (0.20 ± 0.03), (11)C-MeDAS (0.17 ± 0.03), and (11)C-PiB 
      (0.16 ± 0.03). No difference in DVR was detected between (18)F-florbetaben 
      (1.26 ± 0.06) and (18)F-florbetapir (1.27 ± 0.03), but both were significantly 
      higher in DVR than (18)F-flutemetamol (1.17 ± 0.02), (11)C-MeDAS (1.16 ± 0.03), 
      and (11)C-PiB (1.14 ± 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Given their higher binding and longer 
      half-life, our study indicates that (18)F-florbetapir and (18)F-florbetaben are 
      promising tracers for myelin imaging which are readily available for clinical 
      application in demyelinating diseases.

TI  - D(R)e(A)mocracy: A Method to Capitalise on Prior Drug Discovery Efforts to 
      Highlight Candidate Drugs for Repurposing.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25105319 [doi]
LID - 5319
AB  - In the area of drug research, several computational drug repurposing studies have 
      highlighted candidate repurposed drugs, as well as clinical trial studies that 
      have tested/are testing drugs in different phases. To the best of our knowledge, 
      the aggregation of the proposed lists of drugs by previous studies has not been 
      extensively exploited towards generating a dynamic reference matrix with enhanced 
      resolution. To fill this knowledge gap, we performed weight-modulated majority 
      voting of the modes of action, initial indications and targeted pathways of the 
      drugs in a well-known repository, namely the Drug Repurposing Hub. Our method, 
      D(R)e(A)mocracy, exploits this pile of information and creates frequency tables 
      and, finally, a disease suitability score for each drug from the selected 
      library. As a testbed, we applied this method to a group of neurodegenerative 
      diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease and Multiple Sclerosis). 
      A super-reference table with drug suitability scores has been created for all 
      four neurodegenerative diseases and can be queried for any drug candidate against 
      them. Top-scored drugs for Alzheimer's Disease include agomelatine, mirtazapine 
      and vortioxetine; for Parkinson's Disease, they include apomorphine, pramipexole 
      and lisuride; for Huntington's, they include chlorpromazine, fluphenazine and 
      perphenazine; and for Multiple Sclerosis, they include zonisamide, disopyramide 
      and priralfimide. Overall, D(R)e(A)mocracy is a methodology that focuses on 
      leveraging the existing drug-related experimental and/or computational knowledge 
      rather than a predictive model for drug repurposing, offering a quantified 
      aggregation of existing drug discovery results to (1) reveal trends in selected 
      tracks of drug discovery research with increased resolution that includes modes 
      of action, targeted pathways and initial indications for the investigated drugs 
      and (2) score new candidate drugs for repurposing against a selected disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a complex pathology entangling numerous 
      pathological factors, including amyloid-β (Aβ), metal ions, and reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS). Increasing evidence reveals pathological connections among these 
      distinct components in AD. For instance, the association between the amyloid 
      cascade and metal ion hypotheses has introduced a novel pathogenic target: 
      metal-bound Aβ. Investigation of such interconnections requires substantial 
      research and can be expedited by chemical reagents that are able to modify 
      multiple pathogenic factors in AD. Drug repurposing is an efficient approach for 
      rediscovering previously utilized molecules with desirable biological and 
      pharmaceutical properties as chemical reagents. Herein, we report the evaluation 
      of three pre-approved drug molecules, selected based on their chemical structure 
      and properties, as chemical reagents that can be used for elucidating the 
      complicated pathology of AD.

TI  - Opportunities for Drug Repurposing of Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors: Potential 
      Uses in Inflammation, Infection, Cancer, Neuroprotection, and Alzheimer's Disease 
      Prevention.
PG  - 24-29

AB  - Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are safe and widely used for a variety of 
      indications including depressive disorders, anxiety, and chronic pain. Besides 
      inhibiting the serotonin transporter, these medications have broad-spectrum 
      properties in many systems. Their roles have been studied in cancer, Alzheimer's 
      disease, and infectious processes. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the 
      importance of drug repurposing of medications already in use. We conducted a 
      narrative review of current evidence and ongoing research on drug repurposing of 
      SRIs, with a focus on immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, and neuroprotective 
      activity. SRIs may have clinical use as repurposed agents for a wide variety of 
      conditions including but not limited to COVID-19, Alzheimer's disease, and 
      neoplastic processes. Further research, particularly randomized controlled 
      trials, will be necessary to confirm the utility of SRIs for new indications.

TI  - The antibiotic doxycycline mimics the NGF signaling in PC12 cells: A relevant 
      mechanism for neuroprotection.

AB  - Doxycycline has been used as antibiotic since the 1960s. Recently, studies have 
      shown that doxycycline is neuroprotective in models of neurodegenerative diseases 
      and brain injuries, mainly due to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. 
      However, it is not known if doxycycline has neurotrophic potential, which is 
      relevant, considering the role of axonal degeneration at the early stages of 
      neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and 
      Parkinson's disease as well as in normal aging. Axons are preceded by the 
      formation of neurites, the hallmark of the neuronal differentiation induced by 
      neurotrophins like NGF. Therefore, the modulation of neurotrophin receptors aimed 
      at formation and regeneration of axons has been proposed as a strategy to delay 
      the progression of neurodegeneration and has gained relevance as new techniques 
      for early diagnosis arise. Based on these premises, we investigated the potential 
      of doxycycline to mimic the effects of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) with focus on 
      the signaling pathways and neuronal modulators of neurite initiation, growth and 
      branching. We used PC12 cells, a neuronal model widely employed to study the 
      neurotrophic pathways and mechanisms induced by NGF. Results showed that 
      doxycycline induced neurite outgrowth via activation of the trkA receptor and the 
      downstream signaling pathways, PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK, without inducing the 
      expression of NGF. Doxycycline also increased the expression of GAP-43, synapsin 
      I and NF200, proteins involved in axonal and synaptic plasticity. Altogether, 
      these data demonstrate, for the first time, the neurotrophic potential of 
      doxycycline, which might be useful to restore the neuronal connectivity lost at 
      the initial phase of neurodegeneration.

TI  - Repurposing of existing FDA approved drugs for Neprilysin inhibition: An 
      in-silico study.
PG  - 129073
LID - 10.1016/j.molstruc.2020.129073 [doi]
AB  - Neprilysin (NEP) is a neutral endopeptidase with diverse physiological roles in 
      the body. NEP's role in degradation of diverse classes of peptides such as 
      amyloid beta, natriuretic peptide, substance P, angiotensin, endothelins, etc., 
      is associated with pathologies of alzheimer's, kidney and heart diseases, 
      obesity, diabetes and certain malignancies. Hence, the functional inhibition of 
      NEP in the above systems can be a good therapeutic target. In the present study, 
      in-silico drug repurposing approach was used to identify NEP inhibitors. 
      Molecular docking was carried out using GLIDE tool. 2934 drugs from the ZINC12 
      database were screened using high throughput virtual screening (HTVS) followed by 
      standard precision (SP) and extra precision (XP) docking. Based on the XP docking 
      score and ligand interaction, the top 8 hits were subjected to free ligand 
      binding energy calculation, to filter out 4 hits (ZINC000000001427, 
      ZINC000001533877, ZINC000000601283, and ZINC000003831594). Further, induced fit 
      docking-standard precision (IFD-SP) and molecular dynamics (MD) studies were 
      performed. The results obtained from MD studies suggest that ZINC000000601283-NEP 
      and ZINC000003831594-NEP complexes were most stable for 20ns simulation period as 
      compared to ZINC000001533877-NEP and ZINC000000001427-NEP complexes. 
      Interestingly, ZINC000000601283 and ZINC000003831594 showed similarity in binding 
      with the reported NEP inhibitor sacubitrilat. Findings from this study suggest 
      that ZINC000000601283 and ZINC000003831594 may act as NEP inhibitors. In future 
      studies, the role of ZINC000000601283 and ZINC000003831594 in NEP inhibition 
      should be tested in biological systems to evaluate therapeutic effect in NEP 
      associated pathological conditions.

TI  - Investigating Structural Property Relationships to Enable Repurposing of 
      Pharmaceuticals as Zinc Ionophores.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13122032 [doi]
LID - 2032
AB  - The importance of zinc in biology has gained greater recognition in recent years 
      due to its essential contributions to the function of many endogenous enzymes. 
      Disruption of zinc homeostasis may be useful in treating pathological conditions, 
      such as Alzheimer's, and for antiviral purposes. Despite the growth of knowledge 
      and increased interest in zinc, little is known about the structure and function 
      of zinc ionophores. In this study we analyse the Cambridge Structural Database 
      and solution complexation studies found in the literature to identify key 
      functional groups which may confer zinc ionophorism. Pharmaceuticals, 
      nutraceuticals and amino acids with these functionalities were selected to enable 
      us to explore the translatability of ionophoric activity from in vitro assays to 
      cellular systems. We find that although certain species may complex to zinc in 
      the solid and solution states, and may carry ions across simple membrane systems, 
      this does not necessarily translate into ionophoric activity. We propose that the 
      CSD can help refine key functionalities but that ionophoric activity must be 
      confirmed in cellular systems.

TI  - The Coming of Age of the Angiotensin Hypothesis in Alzheimer's Disease: Progress 
      Toward Disease Prevention and Treatment?
PG  - 1443-1466
LID - 10.3233/JAD-171119 [doi]
AB  - There is wide recognition of a complex association between midlife hypertension 
      and cardiovascular disease and later development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
      cognitive impairment. While significant progress has been made in reducing rates 
      of mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular disease over the last thirty 
      years, progress towards effective treatments for AD has been slower. Despite the 
      known association between hypertension and dementia, research into each disease 
      has largely been undertaken in parallel and independently. Yet over the last 
      decade and a half, the emergence of converging findings from pre-clinical and 
      clinical research has shown how the renin angiotensin system (RAS), which is very 
      important in blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular disease, warrants 
      careful consideration in the pathogenesis of AD. Numerous components of the RAS 
      have now been found to be altered in AD such that the multifunctional and potent 
      vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, and similarly acting angiotensin III, are greatly 
      altered at the expense of other RAS signaling peptides considered to contribute 
      to neuronal and cognitive function. Collectively these changes may contribute to 
      many of the neuropathological hallmarks of AD, as well as observed progressive 
      deficiencies in cognitive function, while also linking elements of a number of 
      the proposed hypotheses for the cause of AD. This review discusses the emergence 
      of the RAS and its likely importance in AD, not only because of the multiple 
      facets of its involvement, but also perhaps fortuitously because of the ready 
      availability of numerous RAS-acting drugs, that could be repurposed as 
      interventions in AD.

TI  - Precision medicine for mood disorders: objective assessment, risk prediction, 
      pharmacogenomics, and repurposed drugs.
PG  - 2776-2804

AB  - Mood disorders (depression, bipolar disorders) are prevalent and disabling. They 
      are also highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders. Currently there are 
      no objective measures, such as blood tests, used in clinical practice, and 
      available treatments do not work in everybody. The development of blood tests, as 
      well as matching of patients with existing and new treatments, in a precise, 
      personalized and preventive fashion, would make a significant difference at an 
      individual and societal level. Early pilot studies by us to discover blood 
      biomarkers for mood state were promising [1], and validated by others [2]. Recent 
      work by us has identified blood gene expression biomarkers that track 
      suicidality, a tragic behavioral outcome of mood disorders, using powerful 
      longitudinal within-subject designs, validated them in suicide completers, and 
      tested them in independent cohorts for ability to assess state (suicidal 
      ideation), and ability to predict trait (future hospitalizations for suicidality) 
      [3-6]. These studies showed good reproducibility with subsequent independent 
      genetic studies [7]. More recently, we have conducted such studies also for pain 
      [8], for stress disorders [9], and for memory/Alzheimer's Disease [10]. We 
      endeavored to use a similar comprehensive approach to identify more definitive 
      biomarkers for mood disorders, that are transdiagnostic, by studying mood in 
      psychiatric disorders patients. First, we used a longitudinal within-subject 
      design and whole-genome gene expression approach to discover biomarkers which 
      track mood state in subjects who had diametric changes in mood state from low to 
      high, from visit to visit, as measured by a simple visual analog scale that we 
      had previously developed (SMS-7). Second, we prioritized these biomarkers using a 
      convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach encompassing in a comprehensive 
      fashion prior published evidence in the field. Third, we validated the biomarkers 
      in an independent cohort of subjects with clinically severe depression (as 
      measured by Hamilton Depression Scale, (HAMD)) and with clinically severe mania 
      (as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)). Adding the scores from the 
      first three steps into an overall convergent functional evidence (CFE) score, we 
      ended up with 26 top candidate blood gene expression biomarkers that had a CFE 
      score as good as or better than SLC6A4, an empirical finding which we used as a 
      de facto positive control and cutoff. Notably, there was among them an enrichment 
      in genes involved in circadian mechanisms. We further analyzed the biological 
      pathways and networks for the top candidate biomarkers, showing that circadian, 
      neurotrophic, and cell differentiation functions are involved, along with 
      serotonergic and glutamatergic signaling, supporting a view of mood as reflecting 
      energy, activity and growth. Fourth, we tested in independent cohorts of 
      psychiatric patients the ability of each of these 26 top candidate biomarkers to 
      assess state (mood (SMS-7), depression (HAMD), mania (YMRS)), and to predict 
      clinical course (future hospitalizations for depression, future hospitalizations 
      for mania). We conducted our analyses across all patients, as well as 
      personalized by gender and diagnosis, showing increased accuracy with the 
      personalized approach, particularly in women. Again, using SLC6A4 as the cutoff, 
      twelve top biomarkers had the strongest overall evidence for tracking and 
      predicting depression after all four steps: NRG1, DOCK10, GLS, PRPS1, TMEM161B, 
      GLO1, FANCF, HNRNPDL, CD47, OLFM1, SMAD7, and SLC6A4. Of them, six had the 
      strongest overall evidence for tracking and predicting both depression and mania, 
      hence bipolar mood disorders. There were also two biomarkers (RLP3 and SLC6A4) 
      with the strongest overall evidence for mania. These panels of biomarkers have 
      practical implications for distinguishing between depression and bipolar 
      disorder. Next, we evaluated the evidence for our top biomarkers being targets of 
      existing psychiatric drugs, which permits matching patients to medications in a 
      targeted fashion, and the measuring of response to treatment. We also used the 
      biomarker signatures to bioinformatically identify new/repurposed candidate 
      drugs. Top drugs of interest as potential new antidepressants were pindolol, 
      ciprofibrate, pioglitazone and adiphenine, as well as the natural compounds 
      asiaticoside and chlorogenic acid. The last 3 had also been identified by our 
      previous suicidality studies. Finally, we provide an example of how a report to 
      doctors would look for a patient with depression, based on the panel of top 
      biomarkers (12 for depression and bipolar, one for mania), with an objective 
      depression score, risk for future depression, and risk for bipolar switching, as 
      well as personalized lists of targeted prioritized existing psychiatric 
      medications and new potential medications. Overall, our studies provide objective 
      assessments, targeted therapeutics, and monitoring of response to treatment, that

TI  - Anticancer drugs repurposed for Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/s13195-021-00831-6 [doi]
LID - 96
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between cancer and dementia is triggering growing 
      research interest. Several preclinical studies have provided the biological 
      rationale for the repurposing of specific anticancer agents in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), and a growing number of research protocols are testing their 
      efficacy and safety/tolerability in patients with AD. METHODS: The aim of the 
      present systematic review was to provide an overview on the repurposing of 
      approved anticancer drugs in clinical trials for AD by considering both ongoing 
      and completed research protocols in all phases. In parallel, a systematic 
      literature review was conducted on PubMed, ISI Web, and the Cochrane Library to 
      identify published clinical studies on repurposed anticancer agents in AD. 
      RESULTS: Based on a structured search on the ClinicalTrials.gov and the EudraCT 
      databases, we identified 13 clinical trials testing 11 different approved 
      anticancer agents (five tyrosine kinase inhibitors, two retinoid X receptor 
      agonists, two immunomodulatory agents, one histone deacetylase inhibitor, and one 
      monoclonal antibody) in the AD continuum. The systematic literature search led to 
      the identification of five published studies (one phase I, three phase II, and 
      one phase IIb/III) reporting the effects of antitumoral treatments in patients 
      with mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia. The clinical findings and the 
      methodological characteristics of these studies are described and discussed. 
      CONCLUSION: Anticancer agents are triggering growing interest in the context of 
      repurposed therapies in AD. Several clinical trials are underway, and data are 
      expected to be available in the near future. To date, data emerging from 
      published clinical studies are controversial. The promising results emerging from 
      preclinical studies and identified research protocols should be confirmed and 
      extended by larger, adequately designed, and high-quality clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating condition with no known 
      effective drug treatments. Existing drugs only alleviate symptoms. Given repeated 
      expensive drug failures, we assessed systematically whether approved and 
      investigational AD drugs are targeting products of genes strongly associated with 
      AD and whether these genes are targeted by existing drugs for other indications 
      which could be re-purposed. METHODS: We identified genes strongly associated with 
      late-onset AD from the loci of genetic variants associated with AD at 
      genome-wide-significance and from a gene-based test applied to the most 
      extensively genotyped late-onset AD case (n = 17,008)-control (n = 37,154) study, 
      the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project. We used three gene-to-drug 
      cross-references, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Drugbank and Drug 
      Repurposing Hub, to identify genetically validated targets of AD drugs and any 
      existing drugs or nutraceuticals targeting products of the genes strongly 
      associated with late-onset AD. FINDINGS: A total of 67 autosomal genes (forming 9 
      gene clusters) were identified as strongly associated with late-onset AD, 28 from 
      the loci of single genetic variants, 51 from the gene-based test and 12 by both 
      methods. Existing approved or investigational AD drugs did not target products of 
      any of these 67 genes. Drugs for other indications targeted 11 of these genes, 
      including immunosuppressive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs targeting 
      PTK2B gene products. INTERPRETATION: Approved and investigational AD drugs are 
      not targeting products of genes strongly associated with late-onset AD. However, 
      other drugs targeting products of these genes exist and could perhaps be 
      re-purposing to combat late-onset AD after further scrutiny.

TI  - Drug repositioning based on the heterogeneous information fusion graph 
      convolutional network.
LID - bbab319 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbab319 [doi]
AB  - In silico reuse of old drugs (also known as drug repositioning) to treat common 
      and rare diseases is increasingly becoming an attractive proposition because it 
      involves the use of de-risked drugs, with potentially lower overall development 
      costs and shorter development timelines. Therefore, there is a pressing need for 
      computational drug repurposing methodologies to facilitate drug discovery. In 
      this study, we propose a new method, called DRHGCN (Drug Repositioning based on 
      the Heterogeneous information fusion Graph Convolutional Network), to discover 
      potential drugs for a certain disease. To make full use of different topology 
      information in different domains (i.e. drug-drug similarity, disease-disease 
      similarity and drug-disease association networks), we first design inter- and 
      intra-domain feature extraction modules by applying graph convolution operations 
      to the networks to learn the embedding of drugs and diseases, instead of simply 
      integrating the three networks into a heterogeneous network. Afterwards, we 
      parallelly fuse the inter- and intra-domain embeddings to obtain the more 
      representative embeddings of drug and disease. Lastly, we introduce a layer 
      attention mechanism to combine embeddings from multiple graph convolution layers 
      for further improving the prediction performance. We find that DRHGCN achieves 
      high performance (the average AUROC is 0.934 and the average AUPR is 0.539) in 
      four benchmark datasets, outperforming the current approaches. Importantly, we 
      conducted molecular docking experiments on DRHGCN-predicted candidate drugs, 
      providing several novel approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease (e.g. 
      benzatropine) and Parkinson's disease (e.g. trihexyphenidyl and haloperidol).

TI  - Integrating Comorbidity Knowledge for Alzheimer's Disease Drug Repurposing using 
      Multi-task Graph Neural Network.
PG  - 378-387
AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease that shares common 
      etiologies with its multiple comorbidities, especially vascular diseases. To 
      predict repurposable drugs for AD utilizing the relatively well-investigated 
      comorbidities' knowledge, we proposed a multi-task graph neural network 
      (GNN)-based pipeline that incorporates the corresponding biomedical interactome 
      of these diseases with their genetic markers and effective therapeutics. Our 
      pipeline can accurately capture the interactions and disease classification in 
      the network. Next, we predicted drugs that might interact with the AD module by 
      the node embedding similarity. Our candidates are mostly BBB permeable, and 
      literature evidence showed their potential for treating AD pathologies, 
      accompanying symptoms, or cotreating AD pathology and its common comorbidities. 
      Our pipeline demonstrated a workable strategy that predicts drug candidates with 
      current knowledge of biological interplays between AD and several vascular 
      diseases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several Mendelian randomization studies have been conducted that 
      identified multiple risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, they 
      typically focus on a few pre-selected risk factors. METHODS: A two-sample 
      Mendelian randomization (MR) study was used to systematically examine the 
      potential causal associations of 1037 risk factors/medical conditions and 31 
      drugs with the risk of late-onset AD. To correct for multiple comparisons, the 
      false discovery rate was set at < 0.05. RESULTS: There was strong evidence of a 
      causal association between glioma risk, reduced trunk fat-free mass, lower 
      education levels, lower intelligence and a higher risk of AD. For 31 investigated 
      treatments (such as antihypertensive drugs), we found limited evidence for their 
      associations. DISCUSSION: MR found robust evidence of causal associations between 
      glioma, trunk fat-free, and AD. Our study also confirms that higher educational 
      attainment and higher intelligence are associated with a reduced risk of AD.

AB  - A growing body of clinical and epidemiological research suggests that two of the 
      most common diseases of aging, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and Alzheimer disease (AD), 
      are linked. The nature of the association is not known, but this observation has 
      led to the notion that drugs developed for the treatment of T2DM may be 
      beneficial in modifying the pathophysiology of AD and maintaining cognitive 
      function. Recent advances in the understanding of the biology of T2DM have 
      resulted in a growing number of therapies that are approved or in clinical 
      development for this disease. This review summarizes the evidence that T2DM and 
      AD are linked, with a focus on the cellular and molecular mechanisms in common, 
      and then assesses the various clinical-stage diabetes drugs for their potential 
      activity in AD. At a time when existing therapies for AD offer only limited 
      symptomatic benefit for some patients, additional clinical trials of diabetes 
      drugs are needed to at least advance the care of T2DM patients at risk for or 
      with comorbid AD and also to determine their value for AD in general.

AB  - Type I interferon (IFN-I) signalling represents a major target for modulation in 
      a virus' bid for latency. IFN-I perturbations are also present in such as 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), where viral infections are 
      known to increase symptomatic burden. IFN-I modulation such as via IFNβ-1a, an 
      established MS treatment, has been researched to a limited extent to both AD and 
      COVID-19. In this mini review, we present emerging research on trained immunity 
      as a pathogenetic basis for Alzheimer's disease and the emerging context for 
      IFNβ-1a repositioning, via mechanisms shared with multiple sclerosis and induced 
      by viral infections.

AB  - Computational drug repurposing aims to identify new indications for existing 
      drugs by utilizing high-throughput data, often in the form of biomedical 
      knowledge graphs. However, learning on biomedical knowledge graphs can be 
      challenging due to the dominance of genes and a small number of drug and disease 
      entities, resulting in less effective representations. To overcome this 
      challenge, we propose a "semantic multi-layer guilt-by-association" approach that 
      leverages the principle of guilt-by-association - "similar genes share similar 
      functions", at the drug-gene-disease level. Using this approach, our model 
      DREAMwalk: Drug Repurposing through Exploring Associations using Multi-layer 
      random walk uses our semantic information-guided random walk to generate drug and 
      disease-populated node sequences, allowing for effective mapping of both drugs 
      and diseases in a unified embedding space. Compared to state-of-the-art link 
      prediction models, our approach improves drug-disease association prediction 
      accuracy by up to 16.8%. Moreover, exploration of the embedding space reveals a 
      well-aligned harmony between biological and semantic contexts. We demonstrate the 
      effectiveness of our approach through repurposing case studies for breast 
      carcinoma and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting the potential of multi-layer 
      guilt-by-association perspective for drug repurposing on biomedical knowledge 
      graphs.

      Review.

AB  - To date, there is no cure or disease-modifying agents available for most 
      well-known neurological disorders. Current therapy is typically focused on 
      relieving symptoms and supportive care in improving the quality of life of 
      affected patients. Furthermore, the traditional de novo drug discovery technique 
      is more challenging, particularly for neurological disorders. Therefore, the 
      repurposing of existing drugs for these conditions is believed to be an efficient 
      and dynamic approach that can substantially reduce the investments spent on drug 
      development. Currently, there is emerging evidence that suggests the potential 
      effect of a beta-lactam antibiotic, ceftriaxone (CEF), to alleviate the symptoms 
      of different experimentally-induced neurological disorders: Parkinson's disease, 
      Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epileptic-seizure, brain 
      ischemia, traumatic brain injuries, and neuropathic pain. CEF also affects the 
      markers of oxidative status and neuroinflammation, glutamatergic systems as well 
      as various aggregated toxic proteins involved in the pathogenesis of different 
      neurological disorders. Moreover, it was found that CEF administration to drug 
      dependent animal models improved the withdrawal symptoms upon drug 
      discontinuation. Thus, this review aimed to describe the effects of CEF against 
      multiple models of neurological illnesses, drug dependency, and withdrawal. It 
      also emphasizes the possible mechanisms of neuroprotective actions of CEF with 
      respective neurological maladies.

AB  - RATIONALE: Due to the rising costs of drug development especially in the field of 
      neuropsychiatry, there is increasing interest in efforts to identify new clinical 
      uses for existing approved drugs (i.e., drug repurposing). OBJECTIVES: The 
      purpose of this work was to evaluate in animals the smoking cessation agent, 
      varenicline, a partial agonist at α4β2 and full agonist at α7 nicotinic 
      acetylcholine receptors, for its potential as a repurposed drug for disorders of 
      cognition. METHODS: Oral doses of varenicline ranging from 0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg were 
      evaluated in aged and middle-aged monkeys for effects on the following: 
      working/short-term memory in a delayed match to sample (DMTS) task, 
      distractibility in a distractor version of the DMTS (DMTS-D), and cognitive 
      flexibility in a ketamine-impaired reversal learning task. RESULTS: In 
      dose-effect studies in the DMTS and DMTS-D tasks, varenicline was not associated 
      with statistically significant effects on performance. However, individualized 
      "optimal doses" were effective when repeated on a separate occasion (i.e., 
      improving DMTS accuracy at long delays and DMTS-D accuracy at short delays by 
      approximately 13.6 and 19.6 percentage points above baseline, respectively). In 
      reversal learning studies, ketamine impaired accuracy and increased perseverative 
      responding, effects that were attenuated by all three doses of varenicline that 
      were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: While the effects of varenicline across the 
      different behavioral tasks were modest, these data suggest that varenicline may 
      have potential as a repurposed drug for disorders of cognition associated with 
      aging (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), as well as those not necessarily associated 
      with advanced age (e.g., schizophrenia).

AB  - Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common, irreversible and progressive form of 
      dementia for which the exact pathology and cause are still not clear. At present, 
      we are only confined to symptomatic treatment, and the lack of disease-modifying 
      therapeutics is worrisome. Alteration of Wnt signaling has been linked to 
      metabolic diseases as well as AD. The crosstalk between Canonical Wnt signaling 
      and insulin signaling pathway has been widely studied and accepted from several 
      clinical and preclinical studies that have proven the beneficial effect of 
      antidiabetic medications in the case of memory and cognition loss. This 
      structure-based in silico study was focused on exploring the link between the 
      currently available FDA approved antidiabetic drugs and the Wnt signaling 
      pathway. The library of antidiabetics was obtained from drug bank and was 
      screened for their binding affinity with protein (PDB ID: 3S2K) LRP6, a 
      coreceptor of the Wnt signaling pathway using GLIDE module of Schrodinger. The 
      top molecules, with higher docking score, binding energy and stable interactions, 
      were subjected to energy-based calculation using MMGBSA, followed by a molecular 
      dynamics-based simulation study. Drugs of class α-glucosidase inhibitors and 
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) agonists were found to have a 
      strong affinity towards LRP6 proteins, highlighting the possibility of the 
      modulation of Wnt signaling by antidiabetics as one of the possible mechanisms 
      for use in AD. However, further experimental based in vitro and in vivo studies 
      are warranted for verification and support.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Clinical trials of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have ended with 
      disappointing results, with tremendous resources and time. Repositioning of 
      existing anti-cancer epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) inhibitors in 
      various preclinical AD models has gained growing attention in recent years 
      because hyperactivation of EGFR has been implicated in many neurodegenerative 
      disorders, including AD. Many recent studies have established that EGFR 
      inhibition suppresses reactive astrocytes, enhances autophagy, ameliorates Aβ 
      toxicity, neuroinflammation, and regenerates axonal degradation. However, there 
      is no incontrovertible neuroprotective proof using EGFR inhibitors due to many 
      under-explored signaling transductions, poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
      permeability of the most tested drugs, and disappointing outcomes of most 
      clinical trials. This has caused debate about the possible involvement of EGFR 
      inhibitors in future clinical trials. In this perspective article, we recap 
      recent studies to merge data on the neuroprotective effects of EGFR inhibition. 
      By consequent analysis of previous data, we notably find the under-investigated 
      neuroprotective pathways that highlight the importance of additional research of 
      EGFR inhibitors in attempts to be repurposed as burgeoning therapeutic strategies 
      for AD. Finally, we will discuss future prospective challenges in the 
      repositioning of EGFR inhibitors in AD.

AB  - Saxagliptin (SAX) is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme inhibitor molecule now 
      explored for its activity in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Being extremely 
      hydrophilic, it is unable to permeate the blood-brain barrier by the conventional 
      therapy modalities. Further repurposing the drug, SAX is associated with a 
      reduction in the blood sugar level in the periphery. In the present study, the 
      chitosan-l-valine conjugate was synthesized by carbodiimide chemistry. The 
      conjugate was then used to prepare nanoparticles encapsulating SAX. The 
      nanoparticles were characterized by particle size, surface morphology, and 
      entrapment efficiency. The stability of the formulations was determined by 
      incubation with rat plasma and brain homogenate. The blood brain barrier 
      permeability of the nanoparticles was successfully demonstrated by the 
      incorporation of fluorescent dye, Rhodamine B in the nanoparticles. In vivo 
      studies were conducted in rats and the results showed that the nanoparticles were 
      highly stable in the plasma releasing only a minute amount of SAX (2.5 ng/mL) 
      which was less than the C(max) of the pure SAX (51 ng/mL). The brain uptake 
      studies showed an accumulation of 53 ng/mL SAX from the nanoparticles whereas the 
      pure SAX showed no detectable amount of the drug after 24 h. The pharmacokinetic 
      studies demonstrated that nanoparticles had an (AUC(0-t)) of 3.42 times lower 
      than the pure SAX, indicating the stability of the prepared formulation in the 
      plasma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug repurposing is an innovative approach as it provides new 
      indications for already approved and established drugs. Due to high failure rates 
      and cost involved in traditional drug development procedures, many pharmaceutical 
      companies are primarily focusing on drug repurposing strategy. In Alzheimer 
      disease (AD), existing therapeutic agents only provide symptomatic benefits and 
      does not play a role in disease modification, therefore, an alternative strategy 
      of repurposing can be used to inhibit neurodegeneracy process and other 
      pathological complications. This review discusses the beneficial effects of 
      available licensed drug compounds which can be used as repurposed drugs for the 
      treatment of AD. Moreover, it includes a brief overview of current treatment 
      strategies, including therapies based on nanotechnology and their limitations. 
      METHODS: We attempted an organized scan of peer-reviewed research articles 
      pertinent to licensed drugs that showed beneficial effects in Alzheimer's 
      pathology. Our search includes in vitro studies, epidemiological data and 
      clinical trials. In fact, we have collected, scrutinized, analyzed and discussed 
      all the data that suggested the plausible application of repurposed drugs for the 
      treatment of AD. RESULTS: Cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-Aspartate 
      receptor antagonist are available options to improve the cognitive functions of 
      Alzheimer's patients. These drugs only help in balancing disturbed level of 
      neurotransmitters and are not helpful in disease modification. On the other hand, 
      the nanotechnological based approach has promised to solve some challenges, but 
      has certain limitations such as biocompatibility issues, therefore, it requires 
      an extensive amount of research work. As our main emphasis was on repurposed 
      drugs, we have performed an extensive review of articles to identify compounds 
      that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the 
      treatment of diseases other than Alzheimer's but might have an impact on AD 
      modification based on clinical evidences. Amyloid clearance, tau pathology and 
      anti-inflammatory mechanisms are potential factors that are taken into 
      consideration for disease modification. In addition, the role of bioinformatics 
      and in silico drug repurposing strategy is crucial in the field of drug research, 
      and plays a significant role in the identification of potential repurposed drugs. 
      Thus, we have also mentioned several drug repurposing computational tools that 
      are robust and can predict reliable results based on available gene expression 
      data. DISCUSSION: The major advantage of repurposing strategy is the 
      identification of drug compounds with known mechanism of action, toxicology 
      information and pharmacodynamics profiles; hence, less time is required for 
      devising AD modification treatment. There are some issues as well with this 
      method, which can be resolved by extending our research in this domain. 
      CONCLUSION: AD is incurable, and there is an urgent need to find new treatments, 
      as it is affecting the number of families and society overall. The drug

AB  - Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is the most common and severe age-dependent 
      neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. Notwithstanding the large amount of 
      research dedicated to both the elucidation of this pathology and the development 
      of an effective drug, the multifaceted nature and complexity of the disease are 
      certainly a rationale for the absence of cure so far. Currently available drugs 
      are used, mainly to compensate the decline of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine 
      by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, though they only provide temporary 
      symptomatic benefits and cannot stop AD progression. Although the multiple 
      factors that contribute to trigger AD onset and progression are not yet fully 
      understood, several pathological features and underneath pathways have been 
      recognized to contribute to its pathology, such as metal dyshomeostasis, protein 
      misfolding, oxidative stress and neurotransmitter deficiencies, some of them 
      being interconnected. Thus, there is widespread recent interest in the 
      development of multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) for simultaneous interaction 
      with several pathological targets of AD. In this review, a selection of the most 
      recent reports (2016-up to present) on metal chelators of MTDLs with 
      multifunctionalities is presented. These compounds enable the hitting of several 
      AD targets or pathways, such as modulation of specific biometal ions (e.g., Cu, 
      Fe, Zn) and of protein misfolding (β-amyloid and tau protein), anti-oxidant 
      activity and AChE inhibition. The properties found for these hybrids are 
      discussed in comparison with the original reference compounds, some MTDLs being 
      outlined as leading compounds for pursuing future studies in view of efficient 
      potential applications in AD therapy.

TI  - Donepezil, a drug for Alzheimer's disease, promotes oligodendrocyte generation 
      and remyelination.
PG  - 1386-1393
LID - 10.1038/s41401-018-0206-4 [doi]
AB  - Myelin sheaths play important roles in neuronal functions. In the central nervous 
      system (CNS), the myelin is formed by oligodendrocytes (OLs), which are 
      differentiated from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). In CNS demyelinating 
      disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the myelin sheaths are damaged and the 
      remyelination process is hindered. Small molecule drugs that promote OPC to OL 
      differentiation and remyelination may provide a new way to treat these 
      demyelinating diseases. Here we report that donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase 
      inhibitor (AChEI) developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      significantly promotes OPC to OL differentiation. Interestingly, other AChEIs, 
      including huperzine A, rivastigmine, and tacrine, have no such effect, indicating 
      that donepezil's effect in promoting OPC differentiation is not dependent on the 
      inhibition of AChE. Donepezil also facilitates the formation of myelin sheaths in 
      OPC-DRG neuron co-culture. More interestingly, donepezil also promotes the repair 
      of the myelin sheaths in vivo and provides significant therapeutic effect in a 
      cuprizone-mediated demyelination animal model. Donepezil is a drug that has been 
      used to treat AD safely for many years; our findings suggest that it might be 
      repurposed to treat CNS demyelinating diseases such as MS by promoting OPC to OL 
      differentiation and remyelination.

AB  - Drug repurposing is recently gaining increasing attention, not just from 
      pharmaceutical companies but also from government agencies in an attempt to 
      generate new medications to address increasing unmet medical needs in a cost 
      effective and expedite manner. There are several approaches to identify novel 
      indications for known drugs. Many are based on rational selection e.g. the known 
      or a new mechanism of action of a drug. This review will focus rather on 
      phenotypic or high content screening of compounds in models that are believed to 
      be predictive of effectiveness of compounds irrespective of their mechanism of 
      action. Three short cases studies of screens for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
      disease and spasticity will be given as examples. This article is part of the 
      Special Issue entitled 'Drug Repurposing: old molecules, new ways to fast track 
      drug discovery and development for CNS disorders'.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders are desperately lacking treatment options. It is 
      imperative that drug repurposing be considered in the fight against 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Fenamates have been studied for efficacy in treating 
      several neurodegenerative diseases. The purpose of this review is to 
      comprehensively present the past and current research on fenamates in the context 
      of neurodegenerative diseases with a special emphasis on tolfenamic acid and 
      Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, this review discusses the major molecular 
      pathways modulated by fenamates.

AB  - Drug repurposing represents an attractive alternative to the costly and 
      time-consuming process of new drug development, particularly for serious, 
      widespread conditions with limited effective treatments, such as Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). Emerging generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies like 
      ChatGPT offer the promise of expediting the review and summary of scientific 
      knowledge. To examine the feasibility of using GAI for identifying drug 
      repurposing candidates, we iteratively tasked ChatGPT with proposing the twenty 
      most promising drugs for repurposing in AD, and tested the top ten for risk of 
      incident AD in exposed and unexposed individuals over age 65 in two large 
      clinical datasets: (1) Vanderbilt University Medical Center and (2) the All of Us 
      Research Program. Among the candidates suggested by ChatGPT, metformin, 
      simvastatin, and losartan were associated with lower AD risk in meta-analysis. 
      These findings suggest GAI technologies can assimilate scientific insights from 
      an extensive Internet-based search space, helping to prioritize drug repurposing 
      candidates and facilitate the treatment of diseases.

      Inhibitors.

AB  - Acetylcholinesterase is a prime target for therapeutic intervention in 
      Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are used to improve 
      cognitive abilities, playing therefore an important role in disease management. 
      Drug repurposing screening has been performed on a corporate chemical library 
      containing 11 353 compounds using a target fishing approach comprising 
      three-dimensional (3D) shape similarity and pharmacophore modeling against an 
      approved drug database, Drugbank. This initial screening identified 108 hits. 
      Among them, eight molecules showed structural similarity to the known AChEI drug, 
      pyridostigmine. Further structure-based screening using a pharmacophore-guided 
      rescoring method identifies one more potential hit. Experimental evaluations of 
      the identified hits sieve out a highly selective AChEI scaffold. Further lead 
      optimization using a substructure search approach identifies 24 new potential 
      hits. Three of the 24 compounds (compounds 10b, 10h, and 10i) based on a 
      6-(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)-thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine scaffold showed 
      highly promising AChE inhibition ability with IC(50) values of 13.10 ± 0.53, 
      16.02 ± 0.46, and 6.22 ± 0.54 μM, respectively. Moreover, these compounds are 
      highly selective toward AChE. Compound 10i shows AChE inhibitory activity similar 
      to a known Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug, galantamine, but 
      with even better selectivity. Interaction analysis reveals that hydrophobic and 
      hydrogen-bonding interactions are the primary driving forces responsible for the 
      observed high affinity of the compound with AChE.

      Repurposing Anti-Diabetic Drugs in Neurodegenerative Disorders Using In Silico 
      and In Vitro Approaches.
PG  - 6423-6430
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c06634 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are significant 
      public health burdens. Many studies have revealed the possibility of common 
      pathophysiology between T2DM and AD. Thus, in recent years, studies deciphering 
      the action mechanism of anti-diabetic drugs with their future use in AD and 
      related pathologies are on high demand. Drug repurposing is a safe and effective 
      approach owing to its low cost and time-saving attributes. Microtubule affinity 
      regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) is a druggable target for various diseases and is 
      found to be linked with AD and diabetes mellitus. MARK4 plays a vital role in 
      energy metabolism and regulation and thus serves as an irrefutable target to 
      treat T2DM. The present study was intended to identify the potent MARK4 
      inhibitors among FDA-approved anti-diabetic drugs. We performed structure-based 
      virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs to identify the top hits against MARK4. 
      We identified five FDA-approved drugs having an appreciable affinity and 
      specificity toward the binding pocket of MARK4. Among these identified hits, two 
      drugs, linagliptin, and empagliflozin, favorably bind to the MARK4 binding 
      pocket, interacting with its critical residues and thus subjected to detailed 
      analysis. All-atom detailed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed the 
      dynamics of binding of linagliptin and empagliflozin with MARK4. Kinase assay 
      showed significant inhibition of MARK4 kinase activity in the presence of these 
      drugs, implying them as potent MARK4 inhibitors. In conclusion, linagliptin and 
      empagliflozin may be promising MARK4 inhibitors, which can further be exploited 
      as potential lead molecules against MARK4-directed neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Scope of new formulation approaches in the repurposing of pioglitazone for the 
      management of Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 337-348
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12808 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of 
      dementia among the elderly. The exact cause of the disease is not clearly known, 
      and no existing therapies are able to prevent disease progression. Identification 
      of the possible "impaired brain insulin signalling in AD" enriched the scope for 
      "the repurposing of diabetic drugs in AD management." Among the different classes 
      of diabetic drugs, pioglitazone (PIO), a PPARγ agonist classed as an insulin 
      sensitizer, is of the highest interest for AD management. The drug is reported to 
      have direct action on multiple targets involved in AD, independent of insulin 
      signalling. Even though PIO has appeared to be a potent molecule in preclinical 
      trials, limited success was observed in the clinical stage. The tentative reasons 
      for the limited therapeutic success in the clinical stage are not clear. The main 
      focus of the review is to discuss various factors that might limit the 
      therapeutic success of PIO in clinical trials and possible approaches to overcome 
      those limitations. METHOD: The research articles, review articles, and patents 
      containing information regarding the clinical and preclinical trials of PIO in AD 
      have been reviewed thoroughly using the keywords related to diabetic drugs in AD, 
      PIO for AD management and mechanism of PIO in AD. Literature search was conducted 
      on PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Previous studies have 
      indicated that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the biggest challenge to 
      delivering PIO to the brain. Therefore, to attain a therapeutic concentration in 
      the brain, a higher dose is needed, which is also supported by preclinical 
      investigations in AD; however, in clinical studies, scientists have used the 
      usual diabetic doses. This dose is inadequate to attain a therapeutic 
      concentration in the brain and appears to be the primary reason for the limited 
      success of PIO in clinical trials. The stage of drug intervention and the nature 
      of the study population are also influential factors for the therapeutic 
      response. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The insufficient concentration of the drug 
      reaching the brain appears to be the crucial factor that limits the therapeutic 
      success of PIO in AD management. Since the administration of higher doses cannot 
      be recommended due to safety issues, the current situation demands the use of 
      novel tools to ensure a therapeutic concentration reaches the brain.

TI  - Hypericin as a potential drug for treating Alzheimer's disease and type 2 
      diabetes with a view to drug repositioning.
PG  - 3307-3321
LID - 10.1111/cns.14260 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are two of the most 
      common diseases in elderly population and they have a high rate of comorbidity. 
      Study has revealed that T2D is a major risk factor of AD, and thus exploring 
      therapeutic approaches that can target both diseases has drawn much interest in 
      recent years. In this study, we tried to explore drugs that could be potentially 
      used to prevent or treat both AD and T2D via a drug repositioning approach. 
      METHODS: We first searched the known drugs that may be effective to T2D treatment 
      based on the network distance between the T2D-associated genes and drugs 
      deposited in the DrugBank database. Then, via molecular docking, we further 
      screened these drugs by examining their interaction with islet amyloid 
      polypeptide (IAPP) and Aβ42 peptide, the key components involved in the 
      pathogenesis of T2D or AD. Finally, the binding between the selected drug 
      candidates and the target proteins was verified by molecular dynamics (MD) 
      simulation; and the potential function of the drug candidates and the 
      corresponding targets were analyzed. RESULTS: From multiple resources, 734 
      T2D-associated genes were collected, and a list of 1109 drug candidates for T2D 
      was obtained. We found that hypericin had the lowest binding energy and the most 
      stable interaction with either IAPP or Aβ42 peptide. In addition, we also found 
      that the target genes regulated by hypericin were differentially expressed in the 
      tissues related to the two diseases. CONCLUSION: Our results show that hypericin 
      may be able to bind with IAPP and Aβ42 stably and prevent their accumulation, and 
      thus could be a promising drug candidate for treating the comorbidity of AD and 
      T2D.

AB  - Drug designing is high-priced and time taking process with low success rate. To 
      overcome this obligation, computational drug repositioning technique is being 
      promptly used to predict the possible therapeutic effects of FDA approved drugs 
      against multiple diseases. In this computational study, protein modeling, 
      shape-based screening, molecular docking, pharmacogenomics, and molecular dynamic 
      simulation approaches have been utilized to retrieve the FDA approved drugs 
      against AD. The predicted MADD protein structure was designed by homology 
      modeling and characterized through different computational resources. Donepezil 
      and galantamine were implanted as standard drugs and drugs were screened out 
      based on structural similarities. Furthermore, these drugs were evaluated and 
      based on binding energy (Kcal/mol) profiles against MADD through PyRx tool. 
      Moreover, pharmacogenomics analysis showed good possible associations with AD 
      mediated genes and confirmed through detail literature survey. The best 6 drug 
      (darifenacin, astemizole, tubocurarine, elacridar, sertindole and tariquidar) 
      further docked and analyzed their interaction behavior through hydrogen binding. 
      Finally, MD simulation study were carried out on these drugs and evaluated their 
      stability behavior by generating root mean square deviation and fluctuations 
      (RMSD/F), radius of gyration (Rg) and soluble accessible surface area (SASA) 
      graphs. Taken together, darifenacin, astemizole, tubocurarine, elacridar, 
      sertindole and tariquidar displayed good lead like profile as compared with 
      standard and can be used as possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of AD 
      after in-vitro and in-vivo assessment.

TI  - Is There Justification to Treat Neurodegenerative Disorders by Repurposing Drugs? 
      The Case of Alzheimer's Disease, Lithium, and Autophagy.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22010189 [doi]
LID - 189
AB  - Lithium is the prototype mood-stabilizer used for acute and long-term treatment 
      of bipolar disorder. Cumulated translational research of lithium indicated the 
      drug's neuroprotective characteristics and, thereby, has raised the option of 
      repurposing it as a drug for neurodegenerative diseases. Lithium's 
      neuroprotective properties rely on its modulation of homeostatic mechanisms such 
      as inflammation, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, autophagy, and 
      apoptosis. This myriad of intracellular responses are, possibly, consequences of 
      the drug's inhibition of the enzymes inositol-monophosphatase (IMPase) and 
      glycogen-synthase-kinase (GSK)-3. Here we review lithium's neurobiological 
      properties as evidenced by its neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties, as 
      well as translational studies in cells in culture, in animal models of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in patients, discussing the rationale for the drug's 
      use in the treatment of AD.

AB  - Biomedical data sets are becoming increasingly larger and a plethora of 
      high-dimensionality data sets ("Big Data") are now freely accessible for 
      neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. It is thus important 
      that new informatic analysis platforms are developed that allow the organization 
      and interrogation of Big Data resources into a rational and actionable mechanism 
      for advanced therapeutic development. This will entail the generation of systems 
      and tools that allow the cross-platform correlation between data sets of distinct 
      types, for example, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic. Here, we provide 
      a comprehensive overview of the latest strategies, including latent semantic 
      analytics, topological data investigation, and deep learning techniques that will 
      drive the future development of diagnostic and therapeutic applications for 
      Alzheimer's disease. We contend that diverse informatic "Big Data" platforms 
      should be synergistically designed with more advanced chemical/drug and 
      cellular/tissue-based phenotypic analytical predictive models to assist in either 
      de novo drug design or effective drug repurposing.

AB  - In neurodegenerative diseases, a select set of neuron population displays early 
      vulnerability and undergoes progressive degeneration. The heterogeneity of the 
      cerebral cortex and the heterogeneity of patient populations diagnosed with the 
      same disease offer many challenges for developing effective and long-term 
      treatment options. Currently, patients who are considered to have a 'rare' 
      disease are left with no hopes for cure, and many of the neurodegenerative 
      diseases progress fast without any effective solutions. However, as our 
      understanding of disease mechanisms evolve, we begin to realize that the 
      boundaries between diseases are not as sharp as once believed. There are many 
      patients who develop disease due to common underlying causes and mechanisms. As 
      we move forward with drug discovery effort, it becomes obvious that we will have 
      to shift our focus from finding a cure for a disease, to finding solutions to the 
      disease-causing cellular mechanisms so that patients can be treated by 
      mechanism-based strategies. This paradigm shift will lay the foundation for 
      personalized medicine approaches for neurodegenerative disease patients and 
      patients diagnosed with a rare disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is still not fully 
      understood. Sex modifies AD vulnerability, but the reasons for this are largely 
      unknown. We utilize two independent electronic medical record (EMR) systems 
      across 44,288 patients to perform deep clinical phenotyping and network analysis 
      to gain insight into clinical characteristics and sex-specific clinical 
      associations in AD. Embeddings and network representation of patient diagnoses 
      demonstrate greater comorbidity interactions in AD in comparison to matched 
      controls. Enrichment analysis identifies multiple known and new diagnostic, 
      medication, and lab result associations across the whole cohort and in a 
      sex-stratified analysis. With this data-driven method of phenotyping, we can 
      represent AD complexity and generate hypotheses of clinical factors that can be 
      followed-up for further diagnostic and predictive analyses, mechanistic 
      understanding, or drug repurposing and therapeutic approaches.

TI  - A Study to Decipher the Potential Effects of Butylphthalide against Central 
      Nervous System Diseases Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking 
      Integration Strategy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Butylphthalide (NBP), approved by the China National Medical Products 
      Administration (NMPA) for the treatment of ischemic stroke (IS), showed 
      pleiotropic potentials against central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including 
      neuroprotection and cognitive deficits improvement. However, the effects and 
      corresponding modes of action were not fully explored. This study was designed to 
      investigate the potential of NBP against IS-associated CNS diseases based on 
      network pharmacology (NP) and molecular docking (MD). METHODS: IS was inputted as 
      the index disease to retrieve the "associated diseases" in DisGeNET. 
      Three-database-based IS genes were obtained and integrated (DisGeNET, Malacards, 
      and OMIM). Then, IS-associated genes were identified by combining these genes. 
      Meanwhile, PubMed references and online databases were applied to identify NBP 
      target genes. The IS-related disease-disease association (DDA) network and 
      NBP-disease regulation network were constructed and analyzed in Cytoscape. In 
      silico MD and references were used to validate the binding affinity of NBP with 
      critical targets and the potential of NBP against certain IS-related CNS disease 
      regulation. RESULTS: 175 NBP target genes were obtained, while 312 IS-related 
      disease genes were identified. 36 NBP target genes were predicted to be 
      associated with IS-related CNS diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      epilepsy, major depressive disorder (MDD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
      and dementia. Six target genes (i.e., GRIN1, PTGIS, PTGES, ADRA1A, CDK5, and 
      SULT1E1) indicating disease specificity index (DSI) >0.5 showed certain to good 
      degree binding affinity with NBP, ranging from -9.2 to -6.7 kcal/mol. And the 
      binding modes may be mainly related to hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic "bonds." 
      Further literature validations inferred that these critical NBP targets had a 
      tight association with AD, epilepsy, ALS, and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      proposed a drug-target-disease integrated method to predict the drug repurposing 
      potentials to associated diseases by application of NP and MD, which could be an 
      attractive alternative to facilitate the development of CNS disease therapies. 
      NBP may be promising and showed potentials to be repurposed for treatments for 
      AD, epilepsy, ALS, and depression, and further investigations are warranted to be 
      carefully designed and conducted.

TI  - Network Proximity-based computational pipeline identifies drug candidates for 
      different pathological stages of Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 1907-1920

AB  - Despite the massive investment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), there are still no 
      disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for AD. One major reason is attributed to the 
      limitation of clinical "one-size-fits-all" approach, since the same AD treatment 
      solely based on clinical diagnosis was unlikely to achieve good clinical 
      efficacy. In recent years, computational approaches based on multiomics data have 
      provided an unprecedented opportunity for drug discovery since they can 
      substantially lower the costs and boost the efficiency. In this study, we 
      intended to identify potential drug candidates for different pathological stages 
      of AD by computationally repurposing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
      drugs. First, we assembled gene expression data from three different AD 
      pathological stages, which include mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early and 
      late stages of AD (EAD, LAD). We next quantified the network distances between 
      drug target networks and AD modules by utilizing a network proximity approach, 
      and identified 193 candidates that possessed significant associations with AD. 
      After searching for previous literature evidence, 63 out of 193 (32.6%) predicted 
      drugs were demonstrated to exert therapeutic effects on AD. We further explored 
      the novel mechanism of action (MOA) for these drug candidates by determining the 
      specific brain cells they might function on based on AD patient single cell 
      transcriptomic data. Additionally, we selected several promising candidates that 
      could cross the blood brain barrier together with confirmed neuroprotective 
      effects, and subsequently determined the antioxidative activity of these 
      compounds. Experimental results showed that azathioprine decreased the reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and improved the superoxide 
      dismutase (SOD) activity in APP-SH-SY5Y cells. Finally, we deciphered the 
      potential MOA of azathioprine against AD via network analysis and validated 
      several apoptosis-related proteins (Caspase 3, Cleaved Caspase 3, Bax, Bcl2) 
      through western blotting. In summary, this study presented an effective 
      computational strategy utilizing omics data for AD drug repurposing, which 
      provides a new perspective for drug discovery and development.

      the treatment of dementia.

LID - 10.1101/2024.06.06.597745 [doi]
AB  - Neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
      Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, 
      HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and others significantly affect 
      individuals, their families, caregivers, and healthcare systems. While there are 
      no cures yet, researchers worldwide are actively working on the development of 
      novel treatments that have the potential to slow disease progression, alleviate 
      symptoms, and ultimately improve the overall health of patients. Huge volumes of 
      new scientific information necessitate new analytical approaches for meaningful 
      hypothesis generation. To enable the automatic analysis of biomedical data we 
      introduced AGATHA, an effective AI-based literature mining tool that can navigate 
      massive scientific literature databases, such as PubMed. The overarching goal of 
      this effort is to adapt AGATHA for drug repurposing by revealing hidden 
      connections between FDA-approved medications and a health condition of interest. 
      Our tool converts the abstracts of peer-reviewed papers from PubMed into 
      multidimensional space where each gene and health condition are represented by 
      specific metrics. We implemented advanced statistical analysis to reveal distinct 
      clusters of scientific terms within the virtual space created using 
      AGATHA-calculated parameters for selected health conditions and genes. Partial 
      Least Squares Discriminant Analysis was employed for categorizing and predicting 
      samples (122 diseases and 20889 genes) fitted to specific classes. Advanced 
      statistics were employed to build a discrimination model and extract lists of 
      genes specific to each disease class. Here we focus on drugs that can be 
      repurposed for dementia treatment as an outcome of neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Therefore, we determined dementia-associated genes statistically highly ranked in 
      other disease classes. Additionally, we report a mechanism for detecting genes 
      common to multiple health conditions. These sets of genes were classified based 
      on their presence in biological pathways, aiding in selecting candidates and 
      biological processes that are exploitable with drug repurposing. AUTHOR SUMMARY: 
      This manuscript outlines our project involving the application of AGATHA, an 
      AI-based literature mining tool, to discover drugs with the potential for 
      repurposing in the context of neurocognitive disorders. The primary objective is 
      to identify connections between approved medications and specific health 
      conditions through advanced statistical analysis, including techniques like 
      Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) and unsupervised clustering. 
      The methodology involves grouping scientific terms related to different health 
      conditions and genes, followed by building discrimination models to extract lists 
      of disease-specific genes. These genes are then analyzed through pathway analysis 
      to select candidates for drug repurposing.

TI  - Identifying candidate genes and drug targets for Alzheimer's disease by an 
      integrative network approach using genetic and brain region-specific proteomic 
      data.
PG  - 3341-3354
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddac124 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 75 genetic 
      variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (ad). However, how these variants 
      function and impact protein expression in brain regions remain elusive. 
      Large-scale proteomic datasets of ad postmortem brain tissues have become 
      available recently. In this study, we used these datasets to investigate brain 
      region-specific molecular pathways underlying ad pathogenesis and explore their 
      potential drug targets. We applied our new network-based tool, Edge-Weighted 
      Dense Module Search of GWAS (EW_dmGWAS), to integrate ad GWAS statistics of 
      472 868 individuals with proteomic profiles from two brain regions from two 
      large-scale ad cohorts [parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), sample size n = 190; 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), n = 192]. The resulting network modules 
      were evaluated using a scale-free network index, followed by a cross-region 
      consistency evaluation. Our EW_dmGWAS analyses prioritized 52 top module genes 
      (TMGs) specific in PHG and 58 TMGs in DLPFC, of which four genes (CLU, PICALM, 
      PRRC2A and NDUFS3) overlapped. Those four genes were significantly associated 
      with ad (GWAS gene-level false discovery rate < 0.05). To explore the impact of 
      these genetic components on TMGs, we further examined their differentially 
      co-expressed genes at the proteomic level and compared them with investigational 
      drug targets. We pinpointed three potential drug target genes, APP, SNCA and 
      VCAM1, specifically in PHG. Gene set enrichment analyses of TMGs in PHG and DLPFC 
      revealed region-specific biological processes, tissue-cell type signatures and 
      enriched drug signatures, suggesting potential region-specific drug repurposing 
      targets for ad.

AB  - Drug discovery for disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease and 
      related dementias (ADRD) based on the traditional paradigm of experimental animal 
      models has been disappointing. We describe the rationale and design of the Drug 
      Repurposing for Effective Alzheimer's Medicines (DREAM) study, an innovative 
      multidisciplinary alternative to traditional drug discovery. First, we use a 
      systems biology perspective in the "hypothesis generation" phase to identify 
      metabolic abnormalities that may either precede or interact with the accumulation 
      of ADRD neuropathology, accelerating the expression of clinical symptoms of the 
      disease. Second, in the "hypothesis refinement" phase we propose use of large 
      patient cohorts to test whether drugs approved for other indications that also 
      target metabolic drivers of ADRD pathogenesis might alter the trajectory of the 
      disease. We emphasize key challenges in population-based pharmacoepidemiologic 
      studies aimed at quantifying the association between medication use and ADRD 
      onset and outline robust causal inference principles to safeguard against common 
      pitfalls. Candidate ADRD treatments emerging from this approach will hold promise 
      as plausible disease-modifying therapies for evaluation in randomized controlled 
      trials.

AB  - Dysregulation of gene expression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive, 
      especially at the cell type level. Gene regulatory network, a key molecular 
      mechanism linking transcription factors (TFs) and regulatory elements to govern 
      gene expression, can change across cell types in the human brain and thus serve 
      as a model for studying gene dysregulation in AD. However, AD-induced regulatory 
      changes across brain cell types remains uncharted. To address this, we integrated 
      single-cell multi-omics datasets to predict the gene regulatory networks of four 
      major cell types, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, microglia and 
      oligodendrocytes, in control and AD brains. Importantly, we analyzed and compared 
      the structural and topological features of networks across cell types and 
      examined changes in AD. Our analysis shows that hub TFs are largely common across 
      cell types and AD-related changes are relatively more prominent in some cell 
      types (e.g., microglia). The regulatory logics of enriched network motifs (e.g., 
      feed-forward loops) further uncover cell type-specific TF-TF cooperativities in 
      gene regulation. The cell type networks are also highly modular and several 
      network modules with cell-type-specific expression changes in AD pathology are 
      enriched with AD-risk genes. The further disease-module-drug association analysis 
      suggests cell-type candidate drugs and their potential target genes. Finally, our 
      network-based machine learning analysis systematically prioritized cell type risk 
      genes likely involved in AD. Our strategy is validated using an independent 
      dataset which showed that top ranked genes can predict clinical phenotypes (e.g., 
      cognitive impairment) of AD with reasonable accuracy. Overall, this single-cell 
      network biology analysis provides a comprehensive map linking genes, regulatory 
      networks, cell types and drug targets and reveals cell-type gene dysregulation in 
      AD.

TI  - Generating new drug repurposing hypotheses using disease-specific hypergraphs.
PG  - 261-275
AB  - The drug development pipeline for a new compound can last 10-20 years and cost 
      over $10 billion. Drug repurposing offers a more time- and cost-effective 
      alternative. Computational approaches based on network graph representations, 
      comprising a mixture of disease nodes and their interactions, have recently 
      yielded new drug repurposing hypotheses, including suitable candidates for 
      COVID-19. However, these interactomes remain aggregate by design and often lack 
      disease specificity. This dilution of information may affect the relevance of 
      drug node embeddings to a particular disease, the resulting drug-disease and 
      drug-drug similarity scores, and therefore our ability to identify new targets or 
      drug synergies. To address this problem, we propose constructing and learning 
      disease-specific hypergraphs in which hyperedges encode biological pathways of 
      various lengths. We use a modified node2vec algorithm to generate pathway 
      embeddings. We evaluate our hypergraph's ability to find repurposing targets for 
      an incurable but prevalent disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and compare our 
      ranked-ordered recommendations to those derived from a state-of-the-art knowledge 
      graph, the multiscale interactome. Using our method, we successfully identified 7 
      promising repurposing candidates for AD that were ranked as unlikely repurposing 
      targets by the multiscale interactome but for which the existing literature 
      provides supporting evidence. Additionally, our drug repositioning suggestions 
      are accompanied by explanations, eliciting plausible biological pathways. In the 
      future, we plan on scaling our proposed method to 800+ diseases, combining 
      single-disease hypergraphs into multi-disease hypergraphs to account for 
      subpopulations with risk factors or encode a given patient's comorbidities to 
      formulate personalized repurposing recommendations.Supplementary materials and

TI  - Combining in vitro and in silico Approaches to Find New Candidate Drugs Targeting 
      the Pathological Proteins Related to the Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as the most common cause of dementia among 
      older people has aroused the universal concern of the whole world. However, until 
      now there is still none effective treatments. Consequently, the development of 
      new drugs targeting this complicated brain disorder is urgent and needs more 
      efforts. In this review, we detailed the current state of knowledge about new 
      candidate drugs targeting the pathological proteins especially the drugs which 
      are employed using the combined methods of in vitro and in silico. METHODS: We 
      looked up and reviewed online papers related to the pathogenesis and new drugs 
      development of AD. Then, articles up to the requirements were respectively 
      analyzed and summaried to provide the latest knowledge about the pathogenic 
      effect and the new candidate drugs targeting Aβ and Tau proteins. RESULTS: New 
      candidate drugs targeting the Aβ include decreasing the production, promoting the 
      clearence and preventing aggregation. However these drugs have mostly failed in 
      Phase III clinical trial stage due to the unsuccessful of reversing cognition 
      symptoms. As to tau protein, the prevention of tau aggregation and propagation is 
      a promising strategy to synthesize/design mechanismbased drugs against 
      tauopathies. Some candidate drugs are under research. Moreover, because of the 
      complex pathogenesis of AD, multi-target drugs have also shed light on the 
      treatment of AD. CONCLUSION: Given to the consecutive failure of Aβ-directed 
      drugs and the feasibilities of tautargeted therapy, more and more researchers 
      suggested that the AD treatment should be moved from Aβ to tau or focused on 
      considering the soluble form of Aβ and tau as a whole. Moreover, the novel in 
      silico methods also have great potential in drug discovery, drug repositioning, 
      virtual screening of chemical libraries. No matter how many difficulties and 
      challenges in prevention and treatment of AD, we firmly believe that the 
      effective and safe drugs will be found using the combined methods in the 
      immediate future with the global effort.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
      disease with limited disease-modifying treatments. Drug repositioning strategy 
      has now emerged as a promising approach for anti-AD drug discovery. Using 5×FAD 
      mice and Aβ-treated neurons in culture, we tested the efficacy of Y-2, a 
      compounded drug containing the antioxidant Edaravone (Eda), a pyrazolone and 
      (+)-Borneol, an anti-inflammatory diterpenoid from cinnamon, approved for use in 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. RESULTS: We examined effects of Y-2 
      versus Eda alone by i.p. administered in 8-week-old 5×FAD mice (females) for 4 
      months by comparing cognitive function, Aβ pathologies, neuronal necroptosis and 
      neuroinflammation. Using primary neurons and astrocytes, as well as neuronal and 
      astrocytic cell lines, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms of Y-2 by examining 
      neuronal injury, astrocyte-mediated inflammation and necroptosis. Here, we find 
      that Y-2 improves cognitive function in AD mice. Histopathological data show that 
      Y-2, better than Eda alone, markedly ameliorates Aβ pathologies including Aβ 
      burden, astrogliosis/microgliosis, and Tau phosphorylation. In addition, Y-2 
      reduces Aβ-induced neuronal injury including neurite damage, mitochondrial 
      impairment, reactive oxygen species production and NAD(+) depletion. Notably, Y-2 
      inhibits astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation and attenuates TNF-α-triggered 
      neuronal necroptosis in cell cultures and AD mice. RNA-seq further demonstrates 
      that Y-2, compared to Eda, indeed upregulates anti-inflammation pathways in 
      astrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings infer that Y-2, better than Eda alone, 
      mitigates AD pathology and may provide a potential drug candidate for AD 
      treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalences of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
      continuously increase with the aging of world population. Clinical and 
      epidemiological studies indicate that T2D is an important risk factor for AD. 
      However, the mechanisms underlying the linkage of the two disorders are still not 
      fully elucidated. The aim of this study is to explore the molecular mechanisms of 
      their comorbidity and potential drug targets for AD treatment. METHODS: We first 
      compiled comprehensive lists of genes associated with AD and T2D, respectively. 
      Then, we investigated the signatures of the shared genes and screened for 
      interactions between the hub genes. Subsequently, we used Autodock Vina to 
      perform molecular docking to predict new drug candidates. Lastly, structure and 
      dynamics of docking results were examined by molecular dynamics simulation to 
      verify drug reliability. RESULTS: We obtained 917 AD-associated genes, 631 
      T2D-associated genes and 175 shared genes between the two disorders for 
      subsequent analyses. Functional analysis revealed that metabolic process, lipid 
      and atherosclerosis, AMPK signaling pathway, insulin resistance, chemokines and 
      cytokines were enriched in the shared genes. In addition, 50 central hub genes 
      were identified, including IL6, TNF, INS, IL1B, AKT1, VEGFA, IL10, TP53, PTGS2, 
      TLR4, and others. Finally, we predicted new drug candidates (verdoheme and 
      stannsoporfin) that could be potentially used for AD treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study confirmed that there are important shared genes and pathways between AD and 
      T2D, which may provide clues to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the 
      pathophysiology of the two diseases and help us to discover novel drug candidates 
      for the treatment of AD. The results may also provide clues into identification 
      of new targets and strategies for prevention and therapy of T2D that predisposes 
      to AD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Drug repurposing studies enable shorter routes to the clinic by 
      skipping the steps like in vitro  in vivo screening, chemical optimization and 
      toxicological studies. In our study, we investigated the potent anti-cancer 
      effect of Alzheimer's drug Memantine on 4T1 breast cancer cells. METHODS: 
      Memantine's effect on proliferation of 4T1 cells was evaluated by using the MTT 
      assay. Memantine inhibited 4T1 cell proliferation in a concentration- dependent 
      manner at 24 and 48 hours. We investigated the drug's effect on the protein 
      expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, Casp-3, Casp-9, E-Cad, Vimentin, B-Cat, GSK3B, p-ERK, 
      ERK, p-GS, GS that are involved in apoptosis, metastasis and cell survival. 
      RESULTS: Memantine altered the Bcl-2, Bax, Casp3, Casp-9 apoptotic protein 
      expression levels. We found that memantine inhibited p-Erk expression and that 
      result suggested a plausible mechanism of action for memantine's antineoplastic 
      effect. Memantine also inhibited wound closure at 24 h, significantly (p = 
      0.0055). CONCLUSIONS: Memantine inhibited 4T1 breast cancer cell proliferation at 
      significantly lower doses than mostly studied re-purposed drug Metformin. 
      Therefore, we believe that memantine might hold a great promise as a new 
      repositioned drug in cancer treatment and it is our further interest to 
      investigate its effects in vivo (Fig. 3, Ref. 22).

TI  - Repurposing of Omarigliptin as a Neuroprotective Agent Based on Docking with 
      A(2A) Adenosine and AChE Receptors, Brain GLP-1 Response and Its Brain/Plasma 
      Concentration Ratio after 28 Days Multiple Doses in Rats Using LC-MS/MS.

AB  - The authors in the current work suggested the potential repurposing of 
      omarigliptin (OMR) for neurodegenerative diseases based on three new findings 
      that support the preliminary finding of crossing BBB after a single dose study in 
      the literature. The first finding is the positive results of the docking study 
      with the crystal structures of A(2A) adenosine (A2AAR) and acetylcholine esterase 
      (AChE) receptors. A2AAR is a member of non-dopaminergic GPCR superfamily receptor 
      proteins and has essential role in regulation of glutamate and dopamine release 
      in Parkinson's disease while AChE plays a major role in Alzheimer's disease as 
      the primary enzyme responsible for the hydrolytic metabolism of the 
      neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetate. Docking showed that OMR 
      perfectly fits into A2AAR binding pocket forming a distinctive hydrogen bond with 
      Threonine 256. Besides other non-polar interactions inside the pocket suggesting 
      the future of the marketed anti-diabetic drug (that cross BBB) as a potential 
      antiparkinsonian agent while OMR showed perfect fit inside AChE receptor binding 
      site smoothly because of its optimum length and the two fluorine atoms that 
      enables quite lean fitting. Moreover, a computational comparative study of OMR 
      docking, other 12 DPP-4 inhibitors and 11 SGLT-2 inhibitors was carried out. 
      Secondly, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentration in rats' brain tissue was 
      determined by the authors using sandwich GLP-1 ELISA kit bio-analysis to ensure 
      the effect of OMR after the multiple doses' study. Brain GLP-1 concentration was 
      elevated by 1.9-fold following oral multiple doses of OMR (5 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 
      28 days) as compared to the control group. The third finding is the enhanced BBB 
      crossing of OMR after 28 days of multiple doses that had been studied using 
      LC-MS/MS method with enhanced liquid-liquid extraction. A modified LC-MS/MS 
      method was established for bioassay of OMR in rats' plasma (10-3100 ng/mL) and 
      rats' brain tissue (15-2900 ng/mL) using liquid-liquid extraction. Alogliptin 
      (ALP) was chosen as an internal standard (IS) due to its LogP value of 1.1, which 
      is very close to the LogP of OMR. Extraction of OMR from samples of both rats' 
      plasma and rats' brain tissue was effectively achieved with ethyl acetate as the 
      extracting solvent after adding 1N sodium carbonate to enhance the drug 
      migration, while choosing acetonitrile to be the diluent solvent for the IS to 
      effectively decrease any emulsion between the layers in the stated method of 
      extraction. Validation results were all pleasing including good stability studies 
      with bias of value below 20%. Concentration of OMR in rats' plasma were 
      determined after 2 h of the latest dose from 28 days multiple doses, p.o, 5 
      mg/kg/day. It was found to be 1295.66 ± 684.63 ng/mL estimated from the 
      bio-analysis regression equation. OMR passed through the BBB following oral 
      administration and exhibited concentration of 543.56 ± 344.15 ng/g in brain 
      tissue, taking in consideration the dilution factor of 10. The brain/plasma 
      concentration ratio of 0.42 (543.56/1295.66) was used to illustrate the 
      penetration power through the BBB after the multiple doses for 28 days. Results 
      showed that OMR passed through the BBB more effectively in the multiple dose 
      study as compared to the previously published single dose study by the authors. 
      Thus, the present study suggests potential repositioning of OMR as 
      antiparkinsonian agent that will be of interest for researchers interested in 
      neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs) were recently identified as 
      potential drug targets for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to their role in 
      pathological hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Hyperphosphorylated tau has 
      decreased affinity for microtubule binding, impairing their stability and 
      associated functions. Destabilization of microtubules in neuronal cells leads to 
      neurodegeneration, and microtubule-unbound tau forms neurofibrillary tangles, one 
      of the primary hallmarks of AD. Many phosphorylation sites of tau protein have 
      been identified, but phosphorylation at Ser(262), which occurs in early stages of 
      AD, plays a vital role in the pathological hyperphosphorylation of tau. It has 
      been found that Ser(262) is phosphorylated by MARK4, which is currently an 
      intensively studied target for treating Alzheimer's disease and other 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Our present study aimed to develop a high throughput 
      compatible assay to directly detect MARK enzymatic activity using echoacoustic 
      transfer and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. We optimized the assay for all four 
      isoforms of MARK and validated its use for identifying potential inhibitors by 
      the screening of 1280 compounds from the LOPAC®1280 International (Library Of 
      Pharmacologically Active Compounds). Six MARK4 inhibitors with IC(50) < 1 µM were 
      identified. To demonstrate their therapeutic potential, active compounds were 
      further tested for MARK4 selectivity and ability to cross the blood-brain 
      barrier. Lastly, the molecular docking with the most active inhibitors to predict 
      their interaction with MARK4 was performed.

TI  - Systematic Screening of Associations between Medication Use and Risk of 
      Neurodegenerative Diseases Using a Mendelian Randomization Approach.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11071930 [doi]
LID - 1930
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematically assessing the causal associations between medications 
      and neurodegenerative diseases is significant in identifying disease etiology and 
      novel therapies. Here, we investigated the putative causal associations between 
      23 existing medication categories and major neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), 
      including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: A two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) 
      approach was conducted. Estimates were calculated using the inverse-variance 
      weighted (IVW) method as the main model. A sensitivity analysis and a pleiotropy 
      analysis were performed to identify potential violations. RESULTS: Genetically 
      predisposition to antihypertensives (OR = 0.809, 95% CI = 0.668-0.981, p = 
      0.031), thyroid preparations (OR = 0.948, 95% CI = 0.909-0.988, p = 0.011), and 
      immunosuppressants (OR = 0.879, 95% CI = 0.789-0.979, p = 0.018) was associated 
      with a decreased risk of AD. Genetic proxies for thyroid preparations (OR = 
      0.934, 95% CI = 0.884-0.988, p = 0.017), immunosuppressants (OR = 0.825, 95% CI = 
      0.699-0.973, p = 0.022), and glucocorticoids (OR = 0.862, 95% CI = 0.756-0.983, p 
      = 0.027) were causally associated with a decreased risk of PD. Genetically 
      determined antithrombotic agents (OR = 1.234, 95% CI = 1.042-1.461, p = 0.015), 
      HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (OR = 1.085, 95% CI = 1.025-1.148, p = 0.005), and 
      salicylic acid and derivatives (OR = 1.294, 95% CI = 1.078-1.553, p = 0.006) were 
      associated with an increased risk of ALS. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a systematic 
      view concerning the causal associations between medications and NDs, which will 
      promote the etiology discovery, drug repositioning and patient management for 
      NDs.

TI  - Digital Therapeutics for Improving Effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Drugs and 
      Biological Products: Preclinical and Clinical Studies Supporting Development of 
      Drug + Digital Combination Therapies for Chronic Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/jcm13020403 [doi]
LID - 403
AB  - Limitations of pharmaceutical drugs and biologics for chronic diseases (e.g., 
      medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, or inadequate efficacy) can 
      be mitigated by mobile medical apps, known as digital therapeutics (DTx). 
      Authorization of adjunct DTx by the US Food and Drug Administration and draft 
      guidelines on "prescription drug use-related software" illustrate opportunities 
      to create drug + digital combination therapies, ultimately leading towards 
      drug-device combination products (DTx has a status of medical devices). Digital 
      interventions (mobile, web-based, virtual reality, and video game applications) 
      demonstrate clinically meaningful benefits for people living with Alzheimer's 
      disease, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, 
      depression, and anxiety. In the respective animal disease models, preclinical 
      studies on environmental enrichment and other non-pharmacological modalities 
      (physical activity, social interactions, learning, and music) as surrogates for 
      DTx "active ingredients" also show improved outcomes. In this narrative review, 
      we discuss how drug + digital combination therapies can impact translational 
      research, drug discovery and development, generic drug repurposing, and gene 
      therapies. Market-driven incentives to create drug-device combination products 
      are illustrated by Humira(®) (adalimumab) facing a "patent-cliff" competition 
      with cheaper and more effective biosimilars seamlessly integrated with DTx. In 
      conclusion, pharma and biotech companies, patients, and healthcare professionals 
      will benefit from accelerating integration of digital interventions with 
      pharmacotherapies.

TI  - Preliminary In Vitro and In Vivo Insights of In Silico Candidate Repurposed Drugs 
      for Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is the 
      most common type of dementia. Although a considerably large amount of money has 
      been invested in drug development for AD, no disease modifying treatment has been 
      detected so far. In our previous work, we developed a computational method to 
      highlight stage-specific candidate repurposed drugs against AD. In this study, we 
      tested the effect of the top 13 candidate repurposed drugs that we proposed in 
      our previous work in a severity stage-specific manner using an in vitro BACE1 
      assay and the effect of a top-ranked drug from the list of our previous work, 
      tetrabenazine (TBZ), in the 5XFAD as an AD mouse model. From our in vitro 
      screening, we detected 2 compounds (clomiphene citrate and Pik-90) that showed 
      statistically significant inhibition against the activity of the BACE1 enzyme. 
      The administration of TBZ at the selected dose and therapeutic regimen in 5XFAD 
      in male and female mice showed no significant effect in behavioral tests using 
      the Y-maze and the ELISA immunoassay of Aβ40. To our knowledge, this is the first 
      time the drug tetrabenazine has been tested in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD in a 
      sex-stratified manner. Our results highlight 2 drugs (clomiphene citrate and 
      Pik-90) from our previous computational work for further investigation.

TI  - Disproportionality analysis in VigiBase as a drug repositioning method for the 
      discovery of potentially useful drugs in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 2830-2837
LID - 10.1111/bcp.14690 [doi]
AB  - Drug repositioning aims to propose new indications for marketed drugs. Although 
      several methods exist, the utility of pharmacovigilance databases for this 
      purpose is unclear. We conducted a disproportionality analysis in the World 
      Health Organization pharmacovigilance database VigiBase to identify potential 
      anticholinesterase drug candidates for repositioning in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      METHODS: Disproportionality analysis is a validated method for detecting 
      significant associations between drugs and adverse events (AEs) in 
      pharmacovigilance databases. We applied this approach in VigiBase to establish 
      the safety profile displayed by the anticholinesterase drugs used in AD and 
      searched the database for drugs with similar safety profiles. The detected drugs 
      with potential activity against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterases 
      (BuChEs) were then evaluated to confirm their anticholinesterase potential. 
      RESULTS: We identified 22 drugs with safety profiles similar to AD medicines. 
      Among these drugs, 4 (clozapine, aripiprazole, sertraline and S-duloxetine) 
      showed a human BuChE inhibition rate of over 70% at 10(-5)  M. Their human BuChE 
      half maximal inhibitory concentration values were compatible with clinical 
      anticholinesterase action in humans at their normal doses. The most active human 
      BuChE inhibitor in our study was S-duloxetine, with a half maximal inhibitory 
      concentration of 1.2 μM. Combined with its ability to inhibit serotonin (5-HT) 
      reuptake, the use of this drug could represent a novel multitarget directed 
      ligand therapeutic strategy for AD. CONCLUSION: We identified 4 drugs with 
      repositioning potential in AD using drug safety profiles derived from a 
      pharmacovigilance database. This method could be useful for future drug 
      repositioning efforts.

AB  - As the uncontrolled entry of calcium ions (Ca(2+)) through plasmalemmal calcium 
      channels is a cell death trigger, the conjecture is here raised that mitigating 
      such an excess of Ca(2+) entry should rescue from death the vulnerable neurons in 
      neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). However, this supposition has failed in some 
      clinical trials (CTs). Thus, a recent CT tested whether isradipine, a blocker of 
      the Cav1 subtype of voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs), exerted a benefit 
      in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD); however, outcomes were negative. This 
      is one more of the hundreds of CTs done under the principle of 
      one-drug-one-target, that have failed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other NDDs 
      during the last three decades. As there are myriad calcium channels to let Ca(2+) 
      ions gain the cell cytosol, it seems reasonable to predict that blockade of 
      Ca(2+) entry through a single channel may not be capable of preventing the Ca(2+) 
      flood of cells by the uncontrolled Ca(2+) entry. Furthermore, as Ca(2+) signaling 
      is involved in the regulation of myriad functions in different cell types, it 
      seems also reasonable to guess that a therapy should be more efficient by 
      targeting different cells with various drugs. Here, we propose to mitigate Ca(2+) 
      entry by the simultaneous partial blockade of three quite different subtypes of 
      plasmalemmal calcium channels that is, the Cav1 subtype of VOCCs, the Orai1 
      store-operated calcium channel (SOCC), and the purinergic P2X7 calcium channel. 
      All three channels are expressed in both microglia and neurons. Thus, by 
      targeting the three channels with a combination of three drug blockers we expect 
      favorable changes in some of the pathogenic features of NDDs, namely (i) to 
      mitigate Ca(2+) entry into microglia; (ii) to decrease the Ca(2+)-dependent 
      microglia activation; (iii) to decrease the sustained neuroinflammation; (iv) to 
      decrease the uncontrolled Ca(2+) entry into neurons; (v) to rescue vulnerable 
      neurons from death; and (vi) to delay disease progression. In this review we 
      discuss the arguments underlying our triad hypothesis in the sense that the 
      combination of three repositioned medicines targeting Cav1, Orai1, and P2X7 
      calcium channels could boost neuroprotection and delay the progression of AD and 
      other NDDs.

      study.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in older adults. Drug 
      repositioning is a process of finding new therapeutic applications for existing 
      drugs. One of the methods in drug repositioning is to use the side-effect profile 
      of a drug to identify a new therapeutic indication. The drugs with similar 
      side-effects may act on similar biological targets and could affect the same 
      biochemical process. In this study, we explored the Food and Drug 
      Administration-approved drugs using PROMISCUOUS database to find those that have 
      adverse effects profile comparable with the ligands being studied or used to 
      treat AD. Here, we found that the ropinirole, a dopamine receptor agonist, shared 
      a maximum number of side-effects with the drugs proven beneficial for treating 
      AD. Furthermore, molecular modelling demonstrated that ropinirole exhibited 
      strong binding affinity (-9.313 kcal/mol) and best ligand efficiency (0.49) with 
      sigma-1 receptor. Here, we observed that the quaternary amino group of ropinirole 
      is essential for binding with sigma-1 receptor. Molecular dynamic simulation 
      indicated that the movement of the carboxy-terminal helices (α4/α5) could play a 
      major role in the receptor's physiological functions. The neurotoxicity induced 
      by Aβ(25-35) in SH-SY5Y cells was reduced by ropinirole at concentrations 10, 30, 
      and 50 µM. The effect on spatial learning and memory was examined in mice with 
      Aβ(25-35) induced memory deficit using the radial arm maze. Ropinirole (10 and 
      20 mg/kg) significantly improved the short and long-term memories in the radial 
      arm maze test. Our results suggest that ropinirole has the potential to be 
      repositioned for AD treatment.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

TI  - Tacrine-deferiprone hybrids as multi-target-directed metal chelators against 
      Alzheimer's disease: a two-in-one drug.
PG  - 1460-1475
LID - 10.1039/c8mt00143j [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder 
      affecting several million people worldwide. So far, there is no adequate 
      medication to prevent or slow down the progression of the disease, only 
      medication with palliative effects allowing temporary symptomatic reliefs. As 
      part of our continuing efforts into the development of innovative drugs following 
      a polypharmacological strategy, we decided to use a former anti-AD palliative 
      drug (tacrine) and to reposition it by hybridization with a metal chelating drug 
      (deferiprone, DFP). This combination endows the hybrids with good capacity to 
      inhibit acetylcholinesterase (low micromolar range) and self-/Cu-induced Aβ 
      aggregation (up to ca. 90%) as well as a good radical scavenging ability 
      (micromolar range) and metal (M) chelating capacity, with pM (pM = -log[M], 
      C(L)/C(M) = 10, C(M) = 10(-6) M at pH = 7.4, M = Fe, Cu, Zn) values close to 
      those of DFP. The most promising compounds have 2-hydroxypropyl linkers, and a 
      selection of compounds have demonstrated neuroprotective roles in neuroblastoma 
      cells treated with Aβ(1-42) and ascorbate/iron stressors. Consequently, these 
      hybrids can be considered as attractive multipotent therapeutic molecules that 
      will eventually play key roles against AD progression, namely in the control of 
      cholinergic dysfunction, amyloid peptide aggregation, oxidative stress, and metal 
      modulation, besides presenting a good pharmacokinetic profile.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. To 
      identify AD-related genes from transcriptomics and help to develop new drugs to 
      treat AD. In this study, firstly, we obtained differentially expressed genes 
      (DEG)-enriched coexpression networks between AD and normal samples in multiple 
      transcriptomics datasets by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). 
      Then, a convergent genomic approach (CFG) integrating multiple AD-related 
      evidence was used to prioritize potential genes from DEG-enriched modules. 
      Subsequently, we identified candidate genes in the potential genes list. Lastly, 
      we combined deepDTnet and SAveRUNNER to predict interaction among candidate 
      genes, drug and AD. Experiments on five datasets show that the CFG score of GJA1 
      is the highest among all potential driver genes of AD. Moreover, we found GJA1 
      interacts with AD from target-drugs-diseases network prediction. Therefore, 
      candidate gene GJA1 is the most likely to be target of AD. In summary, 
      identification of AD-related genes contributes to the understanding of AD 
      pathophysiology and the development of new drugs.

AB  - The most common reason behind dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it is 
      predicted to be the third life-threatening disease apart from stroke and cancer 
      for the geriatric population. Till now, only four drugs are available on the 
      market for symptomatic relief. The complex nature of disease pathophysiology and 
      lack of concrete evidence of molecular targets are the major hurdles for 
      developing a new drug to treat AD. The rate of attrition of many advanced drugs 
      at clinical stages makes the de novo discovery process very expensive. 
      Alternatively, Drug Repurposing (DR) is an attractive tool to develop drugs for 
      AD in a less tedious and economic way. Therefore, continuous efforts are being 
      made to develop a new drug for AD by repurposing old drugs through screening and 
      data mining. For example, the survey in the drug pipeline for Phase III clinical 
      trials (till February 2019) consists of 27 candidates, and around half of the 
      number are drugs which have already been approved for other indications. Although 
      in the past, the drug repurposing process for AD has been reviewed in the context 
      of disease areas, molecular targets, there is no systematic review of repurposed 
      drugs for AD from the recent drug development pipeline (2019-2020). In this 
      manuscript, we have reviewed the clinical candidates for AD with emphasis on 
      their development history, including molecular targets and the relevance of the 
      target for AD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent advances in generating massive single-cell/nucleus 
      transcriptomic data have shown great potential for facilitating the 
      identification of cell type-specific Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathobiology and 
      drug-target discovery for therapeutic development. METHODS: We developed The 
      Alzheimer's Cell Atlas (TACA) by compiling an AD brain cell atlas consisting of 
      over 1.1 million cells/nuclei across 26 data sets, covering major brain regions 
      (hippocampus, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, and so on) and cell types 
      (astrocyte, microglia, neuron, oligodendrocytes, and so on). We conducted nearly 
      1400 differential expression comparisons to identify cell type-specific molecular 
      alterations (e.g., case vs healthy control, sex-specific, apolipoprotein E (APOE) 
      ε4/ε4, and TREM2 mutations). Each comparison was followed by protein-protein 
      interaction module detection, functional enrichment analysis, and omics-informed 
      target and drug (over 700,000 perturbation profiles) screening. Over 400 
      cell-cell interaction analyses using 6000 ligand-receptor interactions were 
      conducted to identify the cell-cell communication networks in AD. RESULTS: All 
      results are integrated into TACA (https://taca.lerner.ccf.org/), a new web portal 
      with cell type-specific, abundant transcriptomic information, and 12 interactive 
      visualization tools for AD. DISCUSSION: We envision that TACA will be a highly 
      valuable resource for both basic and translational research in AD, as it provides 
      abundant information for AD pathobiology and actionable systems biology tools for 
      drug discovery. HIGHLIGHTS: We compiled an Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain cell 
      atlas consisting of more than 1.1 million cells/nuclei transcriptomes from 26 
      data sets, covering major brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum) and 
      cell types (e.g., neuron, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and microglia).We conducted 
      over 1400 differential expression (DE) comparisons to identify cell type-specific 
      gene expression alterations. Major comparison types are (1) AD versus healthy 
      control; (2) sex-specific DE, (3) genotype-driven DE (i.e., apolipoprotein E 
      [APOE] ε4/ε4 vs APOE ε3/ε3; TREM2(R47H) vs common variants) analysis; and (4) 
      others. Each comparison was further followed by (1) human protein-protein 
      interactome network module analysis, (2) pathway enrichment analysis, and (3) 
      gene-set enrichment analysis.For drug screening, we conducted gene set enrichment 
      analysis for all the comparisons with over 700,000 drug perturbation profiles 
      connecting more than 10,000 human genes and 13,000 drugs/compounds.A total of 
      over 400 analyses of cell-cell interactions against 6000 experimentally validated 
      ligand-receptor interactions were conducted to reveal the disease-relevant 
      cell-cell communications in AD.

TI  - Deep learning prediction of chemical-induced dose-dependent and context-specific 
      multiplex phenotype responses and its application to personalized alzheimer's 
      disease drug repurposing.

AB  - Predictive modeling of drug-induced gene expressions is a powerful tool for 
      phenotype-based compound screening and drug repurposing. State-of-the-art machine 
      learning methods use a small number of fixed cell lines as a surrogate for 
      predicting actual expressions in a new cell type or tissue, although it is well 
      known that drug responses depend on a cellular context. Thus, the existing 
      approach has limitations when applied to personalized medicine, especially for 
      many understudied diseases whose molecular profiles are dramatically different 
      from those characterized in the training data. Besides the gene expression, 
      dose-dependent cell viability is another important phenotype readout and is more 
      informative than conventional summary statistics (e.g., IC50) for characterizing 
      clinical drug efficacy and toxicity. However, few computational methods can 
      reliably predict the dose-dependent cell viability. To address the challenges 
      mentioned above, we designed a new deep learning model, MultiDCP, to predict 
      cellular context-dependent gene expressions and cell viability on a specific 
      dosage. The novelties of MultiDCP include a knowledge-driven gene expression 
      profile transformer that enables context-specific phenotypic response predictions 
      of novel cells or tissues, integration of multiple diverse labeled and unlabeled 
      omics data, the joint training of the multiple prediction tasks, and a 
      teacher-student training procedure that allows us to utilize unreliable data 
      effectively. Comprehensive benchmark studies suggest that MultiDCP outperforms 
      state-of-the-art methods with unseen cell lines that are dissimilar from the cell 
      lines in the supervised training in terms of gene expressions. The predicted 
      drug-induced gene expressions demonstrate a stronger predictive power than noisy 
      experimental data for downstream tasks. Thus, MultiDCP is a useful tool for 
      transcriptomics-based drug repurposing and compound screening that currently rely 
      on noisy high-throughput experimental data. We applied MultiDCP to repurpose 
      individualized drugs for Alzheimer's disease in terms of efficacy and toxicity, 
      suggesting that MultiDCP is a potentially powerful tool for personalized drug 
      discovery.

TI  - Multimodal single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing data analysis uncovers molecular 
      networks between disease-associated microglia and astrocytes with implications 
      for drug repurposing in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 1900-1912

AB  - Because disease-associated microglia (DAM) and disease-associated astrocytes 
      (DAA) are involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we 
      systematically identified molecular networks between DAM and DAA to uncover novel 
      therapeutic targets for AD. Specifically, we develop a network-based methodology 
      that leverages single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing data from both transgenic mouse 
      models and AD patient brains, as well as drug-target network, metabolite-enzyme 
      associations, the human protein-protein interactome, and large-scale longitudinal 
      patient data. Through this approach, we find both common and unique gene network 
      regulators between DAM (i.e., PAK1, MAPK14, and CSF1R) and DAA (i.e., NFKB1, FOS, 
      and JUN) that are significantly enriched by neuro-inflammatory pathways and 
      well-known genetic variants (i.e., BIN1). We identify shared immune pathways 
      between DAM and DAA, including Th17 cell differentiation and chemokine signaling. 
      Last, integrative metabolite-enzyme network analyses suggest that fatty acids and 
      amino acids may trigger molecular alterations in DAM and DAA. Combining 
      network-based prediction and retrospective case-control observations with 7.2 
      million individuals, we identify that usage of fluticasone (an approved 
      glucocorticoid receptor agonist) is significantly associated with a reduced 
      incidence of AD (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      0.83-0.89, P < 1.0 × 10(-8)). Propensity score-stratified cohort studies reveal 
      that usage of mometasone (a stronger glucocorticoid receptor agonist) is 
      significantly associated with a decreased risk of AD (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 
      0.68-0.81, P < 1.0 × 10(-8)) compared to fluticasone after adjusting age, gender, 
      and disease comorbidities. In summary, we present a network-based, multimodal 
      methodology for single-cell/nucleus genomics-informed drug discovery and have 
      identified fluticasone and mometasone as potential treatments in AD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent years have witnessed major advances in our understanding of 
      the molecular bases of prion diseases. These studies not only highlight the 
      protein misfolding as a potential initiator of a neurodegenerative process, they 
      also provide a foundation for considering whether such a process can be common to 
      many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. This makes prion 
      diseases a sort of prototype of neurodegenerative disease, endowed with some 
      intrinsic positive features in terms of drug development. Thanks to the fact that 
      disappearance of the scrapie protein can serve as a clear readout of drug 
      efficiency, phenotypic approaches have high potential for prion disease drug 
      discovery. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors discuss phenotypic 
      screening and how it lends itself to drug repositioning. Furthermore, they 
      discuss the advantages of working with a molecule with proven safety, 
      tolerability and drug-like properties in combination with a reliable phenotypic 
      screening and how it could improve the success rate for prion drug development. 
      They also provide examples of several interesting candidates that have been 
      identified using this approach, including quinacrine, astemizole, guanabenz and 
      doxycycline. EXPERT OPINION: The availability of persistently scrapie-infected 
      murine neuroblastoma cells has greatly helped to identify compounds that inhibit 
      prion formation. However, a human neuronal model infected with the human isoform 
      would ultimately serve as the ideal disease model toward the discovery of 
      effective drugs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease and a 
      leading cause of dementia. We aim to identify key genes for the development of 
      therapeutic targets and biomarkers for potential treatments for AD. Meta-analysis 
      was performed on six microarray datasets and identified the differentially 
      expressed genes between healthy and Alzheimer's disease samples. Thereafter, we 
      filtered out the common genes which were present in at least four microarray 
      datasets for downstream analysis. We have constructed a gene-gene network for the 
      common genes and identified six hub genes. Furthermore, we investigated the 
      regulatory mechanisms of these hub genes by analysing their interaction with 
      miRNAs and transcription factors. The gene ontology analysis results highlighted 
      the enriched terms significantly associated with hub genes. Through an extensive 
      literature survey, we found that three of the hub genes including GRIN1, SYN2, 
      and SYT1 were critically involved in disease development. To leverage existing 
      drugs for potential repurposing, we predicted drug-gene interaction using the 
      drug-gene interaction database, and performed molecular docking studies. The 
      docking results revealed that the drug compounds had strong interactions and 
      favorable binding with selected hub genes. Lorazepam exhibits a binding energy of 
      -7.3 kcal/mol with GRIN1, Lorediplon exhibits binding energies of -7.7 kcal/mol 
      and -6.3 kcal/mol with the SYT1, and SYN2 respectively. In addition, 100 ns 
      molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the top complexes and apo 
      protein as well. Furthermore, the MM-PBSA free energy calculations also revealed 
      that these complexes are stable and had favorable energies. According to our 
      study, the identified hub gene could serve as a biomarker as well as a 
      therapeutic target for AD, and the proposed repurposed drug molecules appear to 
      have promising efficacy in treating the disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While hypertension is a modifiable risk factor of Alzheimer's disease 
      and related dementias (ADRD), limited studies have been conducted on the 
      effectiveness of antihypertensive medications (AHMs) in altering the progression 
      from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to ADRD; similarly, few studies have 
      assessed drug-drug interactions of AHMs with drugs targeted to modify other risk 
      factors of ADRD such as type II diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. METHOD: 
      128,683 unique hypertensive patients with MCI on US-based Optum claims data were 
      identified. Diuretics, beta blockers (BBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), and angiotensin II 
      receptor antagonists (ARBs) were identified as five major AHM classes. Baseline 
      characteristics were compared. Cox proportional hazards (PH) models were used to 
      study the association between specific AHM exposure and the progression from MCI 
      to ADRD while controlling for demographic variables, comorbidities, and the use 
      of Statins and Metformin. To examine the association of AHM-Statin or 
      AHM-Metformin interaction with ADRD progression, we also investigated models 
      controlling for the aforementioned confounders, as well as drug-drug 
      interactions. RESULT: The study included 100,678 patients who were taking at 
      least one class of AHM and 28,005 who were not taking any AHMs during the study 
      period. AHM users had a higher incidence of comorbidities (all P≤0.039) and 
      consumption of Metformin and Statins (both P<0.001) compared to non-users. Users 
      of each major AHM class showed significantly lower risk of developing ADRD 
      compared to non-users of that specific drug class (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 
      0.96-0.98; all P≤0.048). Within patients on monotherapy (using only one AHM 
      drug), no specific AHM class had significantly lower risk of ADRD diagnosis 
      compared to other AHM drug classes (aHR: 0.97-1.11; all P≥0.053). Use of 
      Diuretics or CCBs in combination with Metformin consumption (aHR: 0.89, 0.91, 
      respectively) showed lower risk of MCI to ADRD progression than use without 
      Metformin consumption (aHR: 0.97, 0.98, respectively), whereas use of any of the 
      five major AHMs with Statin consumption (aHR: 0.91-0.94) all showed lower risk 
      than without Statin consumption (aHR: 0.98-1.04). CONCLUSION: All five major AHM 
      classes showed a protective effect against ADRD progression among hypertensive 
      patients with MCI. Also, certain combinations of AHMs with Metformin or Statins 
      showed a stronger protective effect compared to AHMs alone, and some drug-drug 
      interactions of AHM-Metformin or AHM-Statin also showed protective effects 
      against progression from MCI to ADRD.

      Molecular Mechanisms of Mutant Mitochondrial ATP Synthase.
PG  - 1551-1566
LID - 10.2174/1389201021666200628152246 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal Encephalopathy (NE) is a mitochondrial ATP synthase 
      (mATPase) disease, which results in the death of infants. The case presented here 
      is reportedly caused by complex V deficiency as a result of mutation of Arginine 
      to Cysteine at residue 329 in the mATPase. A recent breakthrough was the 
      discovery of J147, which targets mATPase in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
      Based on the concepts of computational target-based drug design, this study 
      investigated the possibility of employing J147 as a viable candidate in the 
      treatment of NE. OBJECTIVE/METHODS: The structural dynamic implications of this 
      drug on the mutated enzyme are yet to be elucidated. Hence, integrative molecular 
      dynamics simulations and thermodynamic calculations were employed to investigate 
      the activity of J147 on the mutated enzyme in comparison to its already 
      established inhibitory activity on the wild-type enzyme. RESULTS: A correlated 
      structural trend occurred between the wild-type and mutant systems whereby all 
      the systems exhibited an overall conformational transition. Equal observations in 
      favorable free binding energies further substantiated uniformity in the mobility, 
      and residual fluctuation of the wild-type and mutant systems. The similarity in 
      the binding landscape suggests that J147 could as well modulate mutant mATPase 
      activity in addition to causing structural modifications in the wild-type enzyme. 
      CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that J147 can stabilize the mutant protein and 
      restore it to a similar structural state as the wild-type which depicts 
      functionality. These details could be employed in drug design for potential drug 
      resistance cases due to mATPase mutations that may present in the future.

TI  - Repositioning of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon like peptide-1 
      agonists as potential neuroprotective agents.
PG  - 745-748
LID - 10.4103/1673-5374.249217 [doi]
AB  - Repositioning of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon like peptide-1 
      receptor agonists is a breakthrough in the field of neural regeneration research 
      increasing glucagon like peptide-1 bioavailability, hence its neuroprotective 
      activities. In this article, the authors suggest not only crossing blood-brain 
      barrier and neurodegenerative disease as off target for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
      inhibitors and glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists, but also for ophthalmic 
      preparations for diabetic retinopathy, which may be the latest breakthrough in 
      the field if prepared and used in an appropriate nano-formulation to target the 
      retinal nerves. The relation of neurodegenerative diseases' different mechanisms 
      to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon like peptide-1 receptor 
      agonists should be further examined in preclinical and clinical settings. The 
      repositioning of already marketed antidiabetic drugs for neurodegenerative 
      diseases should save the high cost of the time-consuming normal drug development 
      process. Drug repositioning is a hot topic as an alternative to molecular target 
      based drug discovery or therapeutic switching. It is a relatively inexpensive 
      pathway due to availability of previous pharmacological and safety data. The 
      glucagon like peptide-1 produced in brain has been linked to enhanced learning 
      and memory functions as a physiologic regulator in central nervous system by 
      restoring insulin signaling. Intranasal administration of all marketed gliptins 
      (or glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists) may show enhanced blood-brain 
      barrier crossing and increased glucagon like peptide-1 levels in the brain after 
      direct crossing of the drug for the olfactory region, targeting the cerebrospinal 
      fluid. Further blood-brain barrier crossing tests may extend dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 inhibitors' effects beyond the anti-hyperglycemic control to 
      intranasal spray, intranasal powder, or drops targeting the blood-brain barrier 
      and neurodegenerative diseases with the most suitable formula. Moreover, novel 
      nano-formulation is encouraged either to obtain favorable pharmacokinetic 
      parameters or to achieve promising blood-brain barrier penetration directly 
      through the olfactory region. Many surfactants should be investigated either as a 
      solubilizing agent for hydrophobic drugs or as penetration enhancers. Different 
      formulae based on in vitro and in vivo characterizations, working on sister 
      gliptins (or glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists), different routes of 
      administration, pharmacokinetic studies, dose response relationship studies, 
      monitoring of plasma/brain concentration ratio after single and multiple dose, 
      and neurodegenerative disease animal models are required to prove the new method 
      of use (utility) for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors as potential 
      neuroprotective agents. Furthermore, investigations of glucagon like peptide-1 
      receptor agonists' neuroprotective effects on animal models will be considered 
      carefully because they crossed the blood-brain barrier in previous studies, 
      enabling their direct action on the central nervous system. Combination therapy 
      of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
      with already marketed drugs for neurodegenerative disease should be considered, 
      especially regarding the novel intranasal route of administration.

AB  - Drug repositioning has shorter developmental time, lower cost and less safety 
      risk than traditional drug development process. The current study aims to 
      repurpose marketed drugs and clinical candidates for new indications in diabetes 
      treatment by mining clinical 'omics' data. We analyzed data from genome wide 
      association studies (GWAS), proteomics and metabolomics studies and revealed a 
      total of 992 proteins as potential anti-diabetic targets in human. Information on 
      the drugs that target these 992 proteins was retrieved from the Therapeutic 
      Target Database (TTD) and 108 of these proteins are drug targets with drug 
      projects information. Research and preclinical drug targets were excluded and 35 
      of the 108 proteins were selected as druggable proteins. Among them, five 
      proteins were known targets for treating diabetes. Based on the pathogenesis 
      knowledge gathered from the OMIM and PubMed databases, 12 protein targets of 58 
      drugs were found to have a new indication for treating diabetes. CMap 
      (connectivity map) was used to compare the gene expression patterns of cells 
      treated by these 58 drugs and that of cells treated by known anti-diabetic drugs 
      or diabetes risk causing compounds. As a result, 9 drugs were found to have the 
      potential to treat diabetes. Among the 9 drugs, 4 drugs (diflunisal, nabumetone, 
      niflumic acid and valdecoxib) targeting COX2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase 2) were 
      repurposed for treating type 1 diabetes, and 2 drugs (phenoxybenzamine and 
      idazoxan) targeting ADRA2A (Alpha-2A adrenergic receptor) had a new indication 
      for treating type 2 diabetes. These findings indicated that 'omics' data mining 
      based drug repositioning is a potentially powerful tool to discover novel 
      anti-diabetic indications from marketed drugs and clinical candidates. 
      Furthermore, the results of our study could be related to other disorders, such 
      as Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Artificial intelligence-based computational framework for drug-target 
      prioritization and inference of novel repositionable drugs for Alzheimer's 
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying novel therapeutic targets is crucial for the successful 
      development of drugs. However, the cost to experimentally identify therapeutic 
      targets is huge and only approximately 400 genes are targets for FDA-approved 
      drugs. As a result, it is inevitable to develop powerful computational tools that 
      can identify potential novel therapeutic targets. Fortunately, the human 
      protein-protein interaction network (PIN) could be a useful resource to achieve 
      this objective. METHODS: In this study, we developed a deep learning-based 
      computational framework that extracts low-dimensional representations of 
      high-dimensional PIN data. Our computational framework uses latent features and 
      state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to infer potential drug target 
      genes. RESULTS: We applied our computational framework to prioritize novel 
      putative target genes for Alzheimer's disease and successfully identified key 
      genes that may serve as novel therapeutic targets (e.g., DLG4, EGFR, RAC1, SYK, 
      PTK2B, SOCS1). Furthermore, based on these putative targets, we could infer 
      repositionable candidate-compounds for the disease (e.g., tamoxifen, bosutinib, 
      and dasatinib). CONCLUSIONS: Our deep learning-based computational framework 
      could be a powerful tool to efficiently prioritize new therapeutic targets and 
      enhance the drug repositioning strategy.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease 
      worldwide, with one in nine people over the age of 65 living with the disease in 
      2023. In this study, we used a phenome wide association study (PheWAS) approach 
      to identify cross-phenotype between previously identified genetic associations 
      for AD and electronic health record (EHR) diagnoses from the UK Biobank (UKBB) 
      (n=361,194 of European ancestry) and the eMERGE Network (n=105,108 of diverse 
      ancestry). Based on 497 previously identified AD-associated variants from the 
      Alzheimer's Disease Variant Portal (ADVP), we found significant associations 
      primarily in immune and cardiac related diseases in our PheWAS. Replicating 
      variants have widespread impacts on immune genes in diverse tissue types. This 
      study demonstrates the potential of using the PheWAS strategy to improve our 
      understanding of AD progression as well as identify potential drug repurposing 
      opportunities for new treatment and disease prevention strategies.

TI  - The genetic architecture of biological age in nine human organ systems.
LID - 10.1038/s43587-024-00662-8 [doi]
AB  - Investigating the genetic underpinnings of human aging is essential for 
      unraveling the etiology of and developing actionable therapies for chronic 
      diseases. Here, we characterize the genetic architecture of the biological age 
      gap (BAG; the difference between machine learning-predicted age and chronological 
      age) across nine human organ systems in 377,028 participants of European ancestry 
      from the UK Biobank. The BAGs were computed using cross-validated support vector 
      machines, incorporating imaging, physical traits and physiological measures. We 
      identify 393 genomic loci-BAG pairs (P < 5 × 10(-8)) linked to the brain, eye, 
      cardiovascular, hepatic, immune, metabolic, musculoskeletal, pulmonary and renal 
      systems. Genetic variants associated with the nine BAGs are predominantly 
      specific to the respective organ system (organ specificity) while exerting 
      pleiotropic links with other organ systems (interorgan cross-talk). We find that 
      genetic correlation between the nine BAGs mirrors their phenotypic correlation. 
      Further, a multiorgan causal network established from two-sample Mendelian 
      randomization and latent causal variance models revealed potential causality 
      between chronic diseases (for example, Alzheimer's disease and diabetes), 
      modifiable lifestyle factors (for example, sleep duration and body weight) and 
      multiple BAGs. Our results illustrate the potential for improving human organ 
      health via a multiorgan network, including lifestyle interventions and drug 
      repurposing strategies.

LID - e185
AB  - This review focuses on the development of therapeutic interventions for 
      Alzheimer's dementia. While established treatments targeted acetylcholine and 
      NMDA receptors, there is a growing demand for innovative therapies as the aging 
      population increases. The paper highlights the US Food and Drug Administration's 
      approval of aducanumab (Aduhelm) and lecanemab (Leqembi), emphasizing the 
      developmental status of new treatments. Specifically, it covers seven principal 
      drugs in Phase III trials, detailing their mechanisms of action, clinical trial 
      specifics in the United States and Japan, and the current status of regulatory 
      applications. The review focuses on amyloid removal (donanemab), tau protein 
      mitigation (E2814), drug repositioning (Semaglutide, GV1001), and 
      disease-modifying small molecules (fosgonimeton, hydralazine, masitinib). 
      However, Gantenerumab and Solanezumab, unsuccessful in Phase III, are not 
      covered. While the future approval status remains uncertain, we hope these drugs 
      will offer beneficial therapeutic effects for potential dementia patients.

TI  - Foresee novel targets for Alzheimer's disease by investigating repurposed drugs.
LID - 10.2174/1871527321666220622162622 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most rampant neurodegenerative 
      disorder which has caused havoc worldwide. More than a century has passed since 
      the first case of AD was reported, but still no stable treatment is known to 
      mankind. The available medications only provide temporary relief and are not a 
      cure for the disease. The hunt for advanced techniques in drug development has 
      paved the way for drug repurposing, i.e., repositioning or reutilizing drugs as 
      an innovative approach. METHODOLOGY: Several drugs which were repurposed for AD 
      were collected by following PRISMA 2020 systemic review. Databases like PubMed, 
      ScienceDirect, JSTOR, and SciELO were used for data extraction. Further, Drugbank 
      database was used to download all the identified drugs. Later, the Swiss Target 
      Prediction tool was used to identify protein receptors for these drugs and the 
      biological pathway followed by them. RESULTS: Drugs like Zileuton, Salbutamol, 
      Baricitinib, Carmustine, Paclitaxel, and Nilotinib were observed to be involved 
      in regulation of neurotransmitters. Similarly, Metformin, Liraglutide, UDCA, and 
      Bexarotene are involved in protein kinase cascades which also is one of the prime 
      processes in metabolic disorders like AD. Furthermore, drugs like Rosiglitazone, 
      Pioglitazone, and Lonafarnib are involved in interleukin-3 biosynthetic 
      processes, which is again one of the most important processes studied in AD 
      treatment. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that the reviewed drugs that follow 
      similar biological and molecular processes can be repurposed for AD if chosen 
      judiciously with current medications and thus drug repurposing is a promising 
      approach that can be utilized to find a cure for AD within a brief time and fewer 
      resources compared to de novo drug synthesis. Although certain loopholes still 
      need to be worked upon, the technique has great prospects. Furthermore, in silico 
      methods can be utilized to justify the findings and identify the best drug 
      candidate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) analyses have revealed 
      important cellular and functional features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a 
      prevalent neurodegenerative disease. However, our knowledge regarding 
      intercellular communication mediated by dysregulated ligand-receptor (LR) 
      interactions remains very limited in AD brains. METHODS: We systematically 
      assessed the intercellular communication networks by using a discovery snRNA-seq 
      dataset comprising 69,499 nuclei from 48 human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
      samples. We replicated the findings using an independent snRNA-seq dataset of 
      56,440 nuclei from 18 PFC samples. By integrating genetic signals from AD 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics and whole genome 
      sequencing (WGS) data, we prioritized AD-associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms 
      containing dysregulated LR interactions. We further explored drug repurposing for 
      the prioritized LR pairs using the Therapeutic Targets Database. RESULTS: We 
      identified 190 dysregulated LR interactions across six major cell types in AD 
      PFC, of which 107 pairs were replicated. Among the replicated LR signals, we 
      found globally downregulated communications in the astrocytes-to-neurons 
      signaling axis, characterized, for instance, by the downregulation of 
      APOE-related and Calmodulin (CALM)-related LR interactions and their potential 
      regulatory connections to target genes. Pathway analyses revealed 44 GO terms 
      significantly linked to AD, highlighting Biological Processes such as 'amyloid 
      precursor protein processing' and 'ion transmembrane transport,' among others. We 
      prioritized several drug repurposing candidates, such as cromoglicate, targeting 
      the identified dysregulated LR pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrative analysis 
      identified key dysregulated LR interactions in a cell type-specific manner and 
      the associated GO terms in AD, offering novel insights into potential therapeutic 
      targets involved in disrupted cell-cell communication in AD.

TI  - Pharmacological treatment and prevention of cerebral small vessel disease: a 
      review of potential interventions.
PG  - 469-78
LID - 10.1111/ijs.12466 [doi]
AB  - Small vessel disease encompasses lacunar stroke, white matter hyperintensities, 
      lacunes and microbleeds. It causes a quarter of all ischemic strokes, is the 
      commonest cause of vascular dementia, and the cause is incompletely understood. 
      Vascular prophylaxis, as appropriate for large artery disease and cardioembolism, 
      includes antithrombotics, and blood pressure and lipid lowering; however, these 
      strategies may not be effective for small vessel disease, or are already used 
      routinely so precluding further detailed study. Further, intensive antiplatelet 
      therapy is known to be hazardous in small vessel disease through enhanced 
      bleeding. Whether acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which delay the progression of 
      Alzheimer's dementia, are relevant in small vessel disease remains unclear. 
      Potential prophylactic and treatment strategies might be those that target brain 
      microvascular endothelium and the blood brain barrier, microvascular function and 
      neuroinflammation. Potential interventions include endothelin antagonists, 
      neurotrophins, nitric oxide donors and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists, and prostacyclin mimics and 
      phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors. Several drugs that have relevant properties are 
      licensed for other disorders, offering the possibility of drug repurposing. 
      Others are in development. Since influencing multiple targets may be most 
      effective, using multiple agents and/or those that have multiple effects may be 
      preferable. We focus on potential small vessel disease mechanistic targets, 
      summarize drugs that have relevant actions, and review data available from 
      randomized trials on their actions and on the available evidence for their use in 
      lacunar stroke.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects 
      elderly individuals. Recent studies have found that sigma-1 receptor (S1R) 
      agonists can maintain endoplasmic reticulum stress homeostasis, reduce neuronal 
      apoptosis, and enhance mitochondrial function and autophagy, making S1R a target 
      for AD therapy. Traditional experimental methods are costly and inefficient, and 
      rapid and accurate prediction methods need to be developed, while drug 
      repurposing provides new ways and options for AD treatment. In this paper, we 
      propose HNNDTA, a hybrid neural network for drug-target affinity (DTA) 
      prediction, to facilitate drug repurposing for AD treatment. The study combines 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, the HNNDTA model, and 
      molecular docking to identify potential leads for AD. The HNNDTA model was 
      constructed using 13 drug encoding networks and 9 target encoding networks with 
      2506 FDA-approved drugs as the candidate drug library for S1R and related 
      proteins. Seven potential drugs were identified using network pharmacology and 
      DTA prediction results of the HNNDTA model. Molecular docking simulations were 
      further performed using the AutoDock Vina tool to screen haloperidol and 
      bromperidol as lead compounds for AD treatment. Absorption, distribution, 
      metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) evaluation results indicated that 
      both compounds had good pharmacokinetic properties and were virtually non-toxic. 
      The study proposes a new approach to computer-aided drug design that is faster 
      and more economical, and can improve hit rates for new drug compounds. The 
      results of this study provide new lead compounds for AD treatment, which may be 
      effective due to their multi-target action. HNNDTA is freely available at

AB  - Transthyretin (TTR) has a well-established role in neuroprotection in Alzheimer's 
      Disease (AD). We have setup a drug discovery program of small-molecule compounds 
      that act as chaperones enhancing TTR/Amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) interactions. A 
      combination of computational drug repurposing approaches and in vitro biological 
      assays have resulted in a set of molecules which were then screened with our 
      in-house validated high-throughput screening ternary test. A prioritized list of 
      chaperones was obtained and corroborated with ITC studies. Small-molecule 
      chaperones have been discovered, among them our lead compound Iododiflunisal 
      (IDIF), a molecule in the discovery phase; one investigational drug (luteolin); 
      and 3 marketed drugs (sulindac, olsalazine and flufenamic), which could be 
      directly repurposed or repositioned for clinical use. Not all TTR tetramer 
      stabilizers behave as chaperones in vitro. These chemically diverse chaperones 
      will be used for validating TTR as a target in vivo, and to select one repurposed 
      drug as a candidate to enter clinical trials as AD disease-modifying drug.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative dementia in the elderly. 
      Although there is no effective drug to treat AD, proteins associated with AD have 
      been discovered in related studies. One of the proteins is mitochondrial fusion 
      protein 2 (Mfn2), and its regulation presumably be related to AD. However, there 
      is no specific drug for Mfn2 regulation. In this study, a three-tunnel deep 
      neural network (3-Tunnel DNN) model is constructed and trained on the extended 
      Davis dataset. In the prediction of drug-target binding affinity values, the 
      accuracy of the model is up to 88.82% and the loss value is 0.172. By ranking the 
      binding affinity values of 1,063 approved drugs and small molecular compounds in 
      the DrugBank database, the top 15 drug molecules are recommended by the 3-Tunnel 
      DNN model. After removing molecular weight <200 and topical drugs, a total of 11 
      drug molecules are selected for literature mining. The results show that six 
      drugs have effect on AD, which are reported in references. Meanwhile, molecular 
      docking experiments are implemented on the 11 drugs. The results show that all of 
      the 11 drug molecules could dock with Mfn2 successfully, and 5 of them have great 
      binding effect.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders which affects a larger population pose a great 
      clinical challenge. These disorders impact the quality of life of an individual 
      by damaging the neurons, which are the unit cells of the brain. Clinicians are 
      faced with the grave challenge of inhibiting the progression of these diseases as 
      available treatment options fail to meet the clinical demand. Thus, treating the 
      disease/disorder symptomatically is the Hobson's choice. The goal of the 
      researchers is to introduce newer therapies in this segment and introducing a new 
      molecule will take long years of development. Hence, drug 
      repurposing/repositioning can be a better substitute in comparison to time 
      consuming and expensive drug discovery and development cycle. Presently, a 
      paradigm shift towards the re-purposing of drugs can be witnessed. Statins which 
      have been previously approved as anti-hyperlipidemic agents are in the limelight 
      of research for re-purposed drugs. Owing to their anti-inflammatory and 
      antioxidant nature, statins act as neuroprotective in several brain disorders. 
      Further they attenuate the amyloid plaques and protein aggregation which are the 
      triggering factors in the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's respectively. In case of 
      Huntington disease and Multiple sclerosis they help in improving the psychomotor 
      symptoms and stimulate remyelination thus acting as neuroprotective. This article 
      reviews the potential of statins in treating neurodegenerative disorders along 
      with a brief discussion on the safety concerns associated with use of statins and 
      human clinical trial data linked with re-tasking statins for neurodegenerative 
      disorders along with the regulatory perspectives involved with the drug 
      repositioning.

      the cross-talk between diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
      so strong that scientists called it "brain diabetes". According to several 
      studies, the critical factor in this relationship is brain insulin resistance. 
      Due to the rapid global spread of both diseases, overcoming this cross-talk has a 
      significant impact on societies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), on the other 
      hand, have a substantial impact on complex diseases due to their ability to 
      influence gene expression via a variety of mechanisms. Consequently, the 
      regulation of lncRNA expression in chronic diseases permits the development of 
      innovative therapeutic techniques. However, developing a new drug requires 
      considerable time and money. Recently repurposing existing drugs has gained 
      popularity due to the use of low-risk compounds, which may result in cost and 
      time savings. in this study, we identified drug repurposing candidates capable of 
      controlling the expression of common lncRNAs in the cross-talk between DM and AD. 
      We also utilized drugs that interfered with this cross-talk. To do this, high 
      degree common lncRNAs were extracted from microRNA-lncRNA bipartite network. The 
      drugs that interact with the specified lncRNAs were then collected from multiple 
      data sources. These drugs, referred to as set D, were classified in to positive 
      (D(+)) and negative (D(-)) groups based on their effects on the expression of the 
      interacting lncRNAs. A feature selection algorithm was used to select six 
      important features for D. Using a random forest classifier, these features were 
      capable of classifying D(+) and D(-) with an accuracy of 82.5%. Finally, the same 
      six features were extracted for the most recently Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) approved drugs in order to identify those with the highest likelihood of 
      belonging to D(+) or D(-). The most significant FDA-approved positive drugs, 
      chromium nicotinate and tapentadol, were presented as repurposing candidates, 
      while cefepime and dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine were recommended as significant 
      adverse drugs. Moreover, two natural compounds, curcumin and quercetin, were 
      recommended to prevent this cross-talk. According to the previous studies, less 
      attention has been paid to the role of lncRNAs in this cross-talk. Our research 
      not only did identify important lncRNAs, but it also suggested potential 
      repurposed drugs to control them.

AB  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling plays a substantial role in 
      learning and memory. The upregulation of EGFR has been embroiled in the 
      pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, most of EGFR-tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have been extensively studied for non-CNS diseases 
      such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. TKIs targeting-based research in 
      neurodegenerative disorders sounds to be lagging behind those of other diseases. 
      Hence, this study aims to explore the molecular signaling pathways and the 
      efficacy of treatment with lapatinib ditosylate (LAP), as one of EGFR-TKIs that 
      has not yet been investigated in AD, on cognitive decline induced by ovariectomy 
      (OVX) with chronic administration of D-galactose (D-gal) in female Wistar albino 
      rats. OVX rats were injected with 150 mg/kg/day D-gal ip for 8 weeks to induce 
      AD. Administration of 100 mg/kg/day LAP p.o. for 3 weeks starting after the 8(th) 
      week of D-gal administration improved memory and debilitated histopathological 
      alterations. LAP decreased the expression of GFAP, p-tau, and Aβ 1-42. Besides, 
      it reduced EGFR, HER-2, TNF-α, NOX-1, GluR-II, p38 MAPK, and p-mTOR. LAP 
      increased nitrite, and neuronal pro-survival transduction proteins; p-PI3K, 
      p-AKT, and p-GSK-3β levels. Taken together, these findings suggest the role of 
      LAP in ameliorating D-gal-induced AD in OVX rats via activating the pro-survival 
      pathway; PI3K-Akt-GSK-3β, while inhibiting p-mTOR, NOX-1, and p38 MAPK pathways. 
      Moreover, this research offered a significant opportunity to advance awareness of 
      the repositioning of TKI anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of AD.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over 700 million people, with up 
      to 30% developing neurological manifestations, including dementias. However, 
      there is a lack of understanding of common molecular brain markers causing 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). COVID-19 has etiological cofactors with AD, making 
      patients with AD a vulnerable population at high risk of experiencing more severe 
      symptoms and worse consequences. Both AD and COVID-19 have upregulated several 
      shared kinases, leading to the repositioning of kinase inhibitors (KIs) for the 
      treatment of both diseases. This review provides an overview of the interactions 
      between the immune system and the nervous system in relation to receptor tyrosine 
      kinases, including epidermal growth factor receptors, vascular growth factor 
      receptors, and non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Bruton tyrosine kinase, 
      spleen tyrosine kinase, c-ABL, and JAK/STAT. We will discuss the promising 
      results of kinase inhibitors in pre-clinical and clinical studies for both 
      COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as the challenges in repositioning 
      KIs for these diseases. Understanding the shared kinases between AD and COVID-19 
      could help in developing therapeutic approaches for both.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia and 
      represents one of the highest unmet requirements in medicine today. There is 
      shortage of novel molecules entering into market because of poor pharmacokinetic 
      properties and safety issues. Drug repurposing offers an opportunity to 
      reinvigorate the slowing drug discovery process by finding new uses for existing 
      drugs. The major advantage of the drug repurposing approach is that the safety 
      issues are already investigated in the clinical trials and the drugs are 
      commercially available in the marketplace. As this approach provides an effective 
      solution to hasten the process of providing new alternative drugs for AD, the 
      current study shows the molecular interaction of already known antipsychotic 
      drugs with the different protein targets implicated in AD using in silico 
      studies. RESULT: A computational method based on ligand-protein interaction was 
      adopted in present study to explore potential antipsychotic drugs for the 
      treatment of AD. The screening of approximately 150 antipsychotic drugs was 
      performed on five major protein targets (AChE, BuChE, BACE 1, MAO and NMDA) by 
      molecular docking. In this study, for each protein target, the best drug was 
      identified on the basis of dock score and glide energy. The top hits were then 
      compared with the already known inhibitor of the respective proteins. Some of the 
      drugs showed relatively better docking score and binding energies as compared to 
      the already known inhibitors of the respective targets. Molecular descriptors 
      like molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors, acceptors, predicted 
      octanol/water partition coefficient and percentage human oral absorption were 
      also analysed to determine the in silico ADME properties of these drugs and all 
      were found in the acceptable range and follows Lipinski's rule. CONCLUSION: The 
      present study have led to unravel the potential of leading antipsychotic drugs 
      such as pimozide, bromperidol, melperone, anisoperidone, benperidol and 
      anisopirol against multiple targets associated with AD. Benperidol was found to 
      be the best candidate drug interacting with different target proteins involved in 
      AD.

TI  - The Pharmacorank Search Tool for the Retrieval of Prioritized Protein Drug 
      Targets and Drug Repositioning Candidates According to Selected Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/biom12111559 [doi]
LID - 1559
AB  - We present the Pharmacorank search tool as an objective means to obtain 
      prioritized protein drug targets and their associated medications according to 
      user-selected diseases. This tool could be used to obtain prioritized protein 
      targets for the creation of novel medications or to predict novel indications for 
      medications that already exist. To prioritize the proteins associated with each 
      disease, a gene similarity profiling method based on protein functions is 
      implemented. The priority scores of the proteins are found to correlate well with 
      the likelihoods that the associated medications are clinically relevant in the 
      disease's treatment. When the protein priority scores are plotted against the 
      percentage of protein targets that are known to bind medications currently 
      indicated to treat the disease, which we termed the pertinency score, a strong 
      correlation was observed. The correlation coefficient was found to be 0.9978 when 
      using a weighted second-order polynomial fit. As the highly predictive fit was 
      made using a broad range of diseases, we were able to identify a general 
      threshold for the pertinency score as a starting point for considering drug 
      repositioning candidates. Several repositioning candidates are described for 
      proteins that have high predicated pertinency scores, and these provide 
      illustrative examples of the applications of the tool. We also describe focused 
      reviews of repositioning candidates for Alzheimer's disease. Via the tool's URL, 
      https://protein.som.geisinger.edu/Pharmacorank/, an open online interface is 
      provided for interactive use; and there is a site for programmatic access.

TI  - Metabolic Shifts as the Hallmark of Most Common Diseases: The Quest for the 
      Underlying Unity.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22083972 [doi]
LID - 3972
AB  - A hyper-specialization characterizes modern medicine with the consequence of 
      classifying the various diseases of the body into unrelated categories. Such a 
      broad diversification of medicine goes in the opposite direction of physics, 
      which eagerly looks for unification. We argue that unification should also apply 
      to medicine. In accordance with the second principle of thermodynamics, the cell 
      must release its entropy either in the form of heat (catabolism) or biomass 
      (anabolism). There is a decreased flow of entropy outside the body due to an 
      age-related reduction in mitochondrial entropy yield resulting in increased 
      release of entropy in the form of biomass. This shift toward anabolism has been 
      known in oncology as Warburg-effect. The shift toward anabolism has been reported 
      in most diseases. This quest for a single framework is reinforced by the fact 
      that inflammation (also called the immune response) is involved in nearly every 
      disease. This strongly suggests that despite their apparent disparity, there is 
      an underlying unity in the diseases. This also offers guidelines for the 
      repurposing of old drugs.

TI  - Moxifloxacin Disrupts and Attenuates Aβ42 Fibril and Oligomer Formation: 
      Plausibly Repositioning an Antibiotic as Therapeutic against Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 2529-2539
LID - 10.1021/acschemneuro.2c00371 [doi]
AB  - The aggregation of Aβ42 is established as a key factor in the development of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, molecules that inhibit aggregation of 
      peptide may lead to therapies to prevent or control AD. Several studies suggest 
      that oligomeric intermediates present during aggregation may be more cytotoxic 
      than fibrils themselves. In this work, we examine the inhibitory activity of an 
      antibiotic MXF on aggregation (fibrils and oligomers) and disaggregation of Aβ42 
      using various biophysical and microscopic studies. Computational analysis was 
      done to offer mechanistic insight. The amyloid formation of Aβ42 is suppressed by 
      MXF, as demonstrated by the decrease in both the corresponding ThT fluorescence 
      intensity and other biophysical techniques. The lag phase of amyloid formation 
      doubled from 4.53 to 9.66 h in the presence of MXF. The addition of MXF at the 
      completion of the fibrillation reaction, as monitored by ThT, led to a rapid, 
      concentration dependent, exponential decrease in fluorescence signal that was 
      consistent with loss of fibrils. We used TEM to directly demonstrate that MXF 
      caused fibrils to disassemble. Our docking results show that MXF binds to both 
      monomeric and fibrillar forms of Aβ42 with significant affinities. We also 
      observed breaking of fibrils in the presence of MXF through molecular dynamics 
      simulation. These findings suggest that antibiotic MXF could be a promising lead 
      compound with dual role as fibril/oligomer inhibitor and disaggregase for further 
      development as potential repurposed therapeutic against AD.

AB  - Drug repurposing is an efficient approach in new treatment development since it 
      leverages previous work from one disease to another. While multiple sclerosis 
      (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are all 
      neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) and differ in many 
      clinical and pathological aspects, it is possible that they may share some 
      mechanistic features. We hypothesized that focusing on gene expression in a CNS 
      cell type specific manner might uncover similarities between diseases that could 
      be missed using whole tissue gene expression analyses. We found similarities and 
      differences in gene expression in these three distinct diseases, depending upon 
      cell type. Microglia genes were increased in all three diseases, and gene 
      expression levels were correlated strongly among these three neurodegenerative 
      diseases. In astrocytes and endothelia, upregulation and correlations were 
      observed only between MS and PD, but not AD. Neuronal genes were down-regulated 
      in all three diseases, but correlations of changes of individual genes between 
      diseases were not strong. Oligodendrocyte showed gene expression changes that 
      were not shared among the three diseases. Together these data suggest that 
      treatments targeting microglia are most amenable to drug repurposing in MS, PD, 
      and AD, while treatments targeting other CNS cells must be tailored to each 
      disease.

TI  - GCMM: graph convolution network based on multimodal attention mechanism for drug 
      repurposing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The main focus of in silico drug repurposing, which is a promising 
      area for using artificial intelligence in drug discovery, is the prediction of 
      drug-disease relationships. Although many computational models have been proposed 
      recently, it is still difficult to reliably predict drug-disease associations 
      from a variety of sources of data. RESULTS: In order to identify potential 
      drug-disease associations, this paper introduces a novel end-to-end model called 
      Graph convolution network based on a multimodal attention mechanism (GCMM). In 
      particular, GCMM incorporates known drug-disease relations, drug-drug chemical 
      similarity, drug-drug therapeutic similarity, disease-disease semantic 
      similarity, and disease-disease target-based similarity into a heterogeneous 
      network. A Graph Convolution Network encoder is used to learn how diseases and 
      drugs are embedded in various perspectives. Additionally, GCMM can enhance 
      performance by applying a multimodal attention layer to assign various levels of 
      value to various features and the inputting of multi-source information. 
      CONCLUSION: 5 fold cross-validation evaluations show that the GCMM outperforms 
      four recently proposed deep-learning models on the majority of the criteria. It 
      shows that GCMM can predict drug-disease relationships reliably and suggests 
      improvement in the desired metrics. Hyper-parameter analysis and exploratory 
      ablation experiments are also provided to demonstrate the necessity of each 
      module of the model and the highest possible level of prediction performance. 
      Additionally, a case study on Alzheimer's disease (AD). Four of the five 
      medications indicated by GCMM to have the highest potential correlation 
      coefficient with AD have been demonstrated through literature or experimental 
      research, demonstrating the viability of GCMM. All of these results imply that 
      GCMM can provide a strong and effective tool for drug development and 
      repositioning.

TI  - The Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride in the Twitcher Mouse Model of Krabbe 
      Disease.
LID - 10.1007/s12035-024-04137-0 [doi]
AB  - Krabbe disease (KD) is a rare demyelinating disorder characterized by 
      demyelination caused by mutations in the GALC gene, resulting in toxic 
      accumulation of psychosine. Psychosine has been identified as detrimental to 
      oligodendrocytes, leading to demyelination through diverse hypothesized pathways. 
      Reducing demyelination is essential to maintain neurological function in KD; 
      however, therapeutic interventions are currently limited. Acetylcholinesterase 
      inhibitors (AChEi) are commonly used for symptomatic management of Alzheimer's 
      Disease and are suggested to have potential disease-modifying effects, including 
      regulating myelin state. In particular, donepezil, an AChEi, has demonstrated 
      promising effects in cellular and animal models, including promotion of the 
      expression of myelin-related genes and reduction of glial cell reactivity. This 
      drug also acts as an agonist for sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1R), which are implicated 
      in demyelination diseases. In the context of drug repurposing, here, we 
      demonstrate that administration of donepezil has protective effects in the 
      twitcher mouse model of KD. We provide data showing that donepezil preserves 
      myelin and reduces glial cell reactivity in the brains of twitcher mice. 
      Moreover, donepezil also improves behavioral phenotypes and increases lifespan in 
      twitcher animals. These findings suggest that donepezil, with its dual activity 
      as an AChE inhibitor and Sig-1R agonist, may hold promise as a therapeutic 
      candidate for demyelinating diseases, including KD.

TI  - A multimodal precision-prevention approach combining lifestyle intervention with 
      metformin repurposing to prevent cognitive impairment and disability: the 
      MET-FINGER randomised controlled trial protocol.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/s13195-023-01355-x [doi]
LID - 23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combining multimodal lifestyle interventions and disease-modifying 
      drugs (novel or repurposed) could provide novel precision approaches to prevent 
      cognitive impairment. Metformin is a promising candidate in view of the 
      well-established link between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's Disease and 
      emerging evidence of its potential neuro-protective effects (e.g. vascular, 
      metabolic, anti-senescence). MET-FINGER aims to test a FINGER 2.0 multimodal 
      intervention, combining an updated FINGER multidomain lifestyle intervention with 
      metformin, where appropriate, in an APOE ε4-enriched population of older adults 
      (60-79 years) at increased risk of dementia. METHODS: MET-FINGER is an 
      international randomised, controlled, parallel-group, phase-IIb proof-of-concept 
      clinical trial, where metformin is included through a trial-within-trial design. 
      600 participants will be recruited at three sites (UK, Finland, Sweden). 
      Participants at increased risk of dementia based on vascular risk factors and 
      cognitive screening, will be first randomised to the FINGER 2.0 intervention 
      (lifestyle + metformin if eligible; active arm) or to receive regular health 
      advice (control arm). Participants allocated to the FINGER 2.0 intervention group 
      at risk indicators of T2D will be additionally randomised to receive metformin 
      (2000 mg/day or 1000 mg/day) or placebo. The study duration is 2 years. The 
      changes in global cognition (primary outcome, using a Neuropsychological Test 
      Battery), memory, executive function, and processing speed cognitive domains; 
      functional status; lifestyle, vascular, metabolic, and other dementia-related 
      risk factors (secondary outcomes), will be compared between the FINGER 2.0 
      intervention and the control arm. The feasibility, potential interaction 
      (between-groups differences in healthy lifestyle changes), and disease-modifying 
      effects of the lifestyle-metformin combination will be exploratory outcomes. The 
      lifestyle intervention is adapted from the original FINGER trial (diet, physical 
      activity, cognitive training, monitoring of cardiovascular/metabolic risk 
      factors, social interaction) to be consistently delivered in three countries. 
      Metformin is administered as Glucophage®XR/SR 500, (500 mg oral tablets). The 
      metformin/placebo treatment will be double blinded. CONCLUSION: MET-FINGER is the 
      first trial combining a multimodal lifestyle intervention with a putative 
      repurposed disease-modifying drug for cognitive impairment prevention. Although 
      preliminary, its findings will provide crucial information for innovative 
      precision prevention strategies and form the basis for a larger phase-III trial 
      design and future research in this field. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov 
      (NCT05109169).

TI  - High-Throughput Screening for Identification of Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity 
      Enhancers: A Drug Repurposing Opportunity to Rectify Vascular Amyloid Toxicity.
PG  - 1499-516
LID - 10.3233/JAD-151179 [doi]
AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic interface that maintains brain 
      homeostasis and protects it from free entry of chemicals, toxins, and drugs. The 
      barrier function of the BBB is maintained mainly by capillary endothelial cells 
      that physically separate brain from blood. Several neurological diseases, such as 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), are known to disrupt BBB integrity. In this study, a 
      high-throughput screening (HTS) was developed to identify drugs that 
      rectify/protect BBB integrity from vascular amyloid toxicity associated with AD 
      progression. Assessing Lucifer Yellow permeation across in-vitro BBB model 
      composed from mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd3) grown on 96-well plate 
      inserts was used to screen 1280 compounds of Sigma LOPAC®1280 library for 
      modulators of bEnd3 monolayer integrity. HTS identified 62 compounds as 
      disruptors, and 50 compounds as enhancers of the endothelial barrier integrity. 
      From these 50 enhancers, 7 FDA approved drugs were identified with EC50 values 
      ranging from 0.76-4.56 μM. Of these 7 drugs, 5 were able to protect bEnd3-based 
      BBB model integrity against amyloid toxicity. Furthermore, to test the 
      translational potential to humans, the 7 drugs were tested for their ability to 
      rectify the disruptive effect of Aβ in the human endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3. 
      Only 3 (etodolac, granisetron, and beclomethasone) out of the 5 effective drugs 
      in the bEnd3-based BBB model demonstrated a promising effect to protect the 
      hCMEC/D3-based BBB model integrity. These drugs are compelling candidates for 
      repurposing as therapeutic agents that could rectify dysfunctional BBB associated 
      with AD.

TI  - Gabapentin Inhibits Multiple Steps in the Amyloid Beta Toxicity Cascade.
PG  - 3064-3076
LID - 10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00414 [doi]
AB  - Oligomeric β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) is one of the main neurotoxic agents of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oligomers associate to neuronal membranes, forming 
      "pore-like" structures that cause intracellular calcium and neurotransmitter 
      dyshomeostasis, leading to synaptic failure and death. Through molecular 
      screening targeting the C terminal region of Aβ, a region involved in the toxic 
      properties of the peptide, we detected an FDA approved compound, gabapentin 
      (GBP), with neuroprotective effects against Aβ toxicity. At micromolar 
      concentrations, GBP antagonized peptide aggregation over time and reduced the Aβ 
      absorbance plateau to 28% of control. In addition, GBP decreased Aβ association 
      to membranes by almost half, and the effects of Aβ on intracellular calcium in 
      hippocampal neurons were antagonized without causing effects on its own. Finally, 
      we found that GBP was able to block the synaptotoxicity induced by Aβ in 
      hippocampal neurons, increasing post-synaptic currents from 1.7 ± 0.9 to 4.2 ± 
      0.7 fC and mean relative fluorescence intensity values of SV2, a synaptic 
      protein, from 0.7 ± 0.09 to 1.00 ± 0.08. The results show that GBP can interfere 
      with Aβ-induced toxicity by blocking multiple steps, resulting in 
      neuroprotection, which justifies advancing toward additional animal and human 
      studies.

TI  - Computational drug repositioning through heterogeneous network clustering.
PG  - S6
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-7-S5-S6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the costly and time consuming process and high attrition rates 
      in drug discovery and development, drug repositioning or drug repurposing is 
      considered as a viable strategy both to replenish the drying out drug pipelines 
      and to surmount the innovation gap. Although there is a growing recognition that 
      mechanistic relationships from molecular to systems level should be integrated 
      into drug discovery paradigms, relatively few studies have integrated information 
      about heterogeneous networks into computational drug-repositioning candidate 
      discovery platforms. RESULTS: Using known disease-gene and drug-target 
      relationships from the KEGG database, we built a weighted disease and drug 
      heterogeneous network. The nodes represent drugs or diseases while the edges 
      represent shared gene, biological process, pathway, phenotype or a combination of 
      these features. We clustered this weighted network to identify modules and then 
      assembled all possible drug-disease pairs (putative drug repositioning 
      candidates) from these modules. We validated our predictions by testing their 
      robustness and evaluated them by their overlap with drug indications that were 
      either reported in published literature or investigated in clinical trials. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Previous computational approaches for drug repositioning focused 
      either on drug-drug and disease-disease similarity approaches whereas we have 
      taken a more holistic approach by considering drug-disease relationships also. 
      Further, we considered not only gene but also other features to build the disease 
      drug networks. Despite the relative simplicity of our approach, based on the 
      robustness analyses and the overlap of some of our predictions with drug 
      indications that are under investigation, we believe our approach could 
      complement the current computational approaches for drug repositioning candidate 
      discovery.

AB  - Short-term memory dysfunction is a key early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      Psychiatric patients may be at higher risk for memory dysfunction and subsequent 
      AD due to the negative effects of stress and depression on the brain. We carried 
      out longitudinal within-subject studies in male and female psychiatric patients 
      to discover blood gene expression biomarkers that track short term memory as 
      measured by the retention measure in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. These 
      biomarkers were subsequently prioritized with a convergent functional genomics 
      approach using previous evidence in the field implicating them in AD. The top 
      candidate biomarkers were then tested in an independent cohort for ability to 
      predict state short-term memory, and trait future positive neuropsychological 
      testing for cognitive impairment. The best overall evidence was for a series of 
      new, as well as some previously known genes, which are now newly shown to have 
      functional evidence in humans as blood biomarkers: RAB7A, NPC2, TGFB1, GAP43, 
      ARSB, PER1, GUSB, and MAPT. Additional top blood biomarkers include GSK3B, PTGS2, 
      APOE, BACE1, PSEN1, and TREM2, well known genes implicated in AD by previous 
      brain and genetic studies, in humans and animal models, which serve as reassuring 
      de facto positive controls for our whole-genome gene expression discovery 
      approach. Biological pathway analyses implicate LXR/RXR activation, 
      neuroinflammation, atherosclerosis signaling, and amyloid processing. 
      Co-directionality of expression data provide new mechanistic insights that are 
      consistent with a compensatory/scarring scenario for brain pathological changes. 
      A majority of top biomarkers also have evidence for involvement in other 
      psychiatric disorders, particularly stress, providing a molecular basis for 
      clinical co-morbidity and for stress as an early precipitant/risk factor. Some of 
      them are modulated by existing drugs, such as antidepressants, lithium and 
      omega-3 fatty acids. Other drug and nutraceutical leads were identified through 
      bioinformatic drug repurposing analyses (such as pioglitazone, levonorgestrel, 
      salsolidine, ginkgolide A, and icariin). Our work contributes to the overall 
      pathophysiological understanding of memory disorders and AD. It also opens new 
      avenues for precision medicine- diagnostics (assement of risk) as well as early 
      treatment (pharmacogenomically informed, personalized, and preventive).

TI  - Clinical utility of neuroprotective agents in neurodegenerative diseases: current 
      status of drug development for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's 
      diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: According to the definition of the Committee to Identify 
      Neuroprotective Agents in Parkinson's Disease (CINAPS), "neuroprotection would be 
      any intervention that favourably influences the disease process or underlying 
      pathogenesis to produce enduring benefits for patients" [Meissner W, et al. 
      Trends Pharmacol Sci 2004;25:249-253]. Preferably, neuroprotective agents should 
      be used before or eventually during the prodromal phase of the diseases that 
      could start decades before the appearance of symptoms. Although several 
      symptomatic drugs are available, a disease-modifying agent is still elusive. 
      AREAS COVERED: The aim of the present review is to give an overview of 
      neuroprotective agents being currently investigated for the treatment of AD, PD, 
      HD and ALS in clinical phases. EXPERT OPINION: Development of effective 
      neuroprotective therapies resulting in clinically meaningful results is hampered 
      by several factors in all research stages, both conceptual and methodological. 
      Novel solutions might be offered by evaluation of new targets throughout clinical 
      studies, therapies emerging from drug repositioning approaches, multi-target 
      approaches and network pharmacology.

TI  - The functional therapeutic chemical classification system.
PG  - 876-83
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt628 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Drug repositioning is the discovery of new indications for compounds 
      that have already been approved and used in a clinical setting. Recently, some 
      computational approaches have been suggested to unveil new opportunities in a 
      systematic fashion, by taking into consideration gene expression signatures or 
      chemical features for instance. We present here a novel method based on knowledge 
      integration using semantic technologies, to capture the functional role of 
      approved chemical compounds. RESULTS: In order to computationally generate 
      repositioning hypotheses, we used the Web Ontology Language to formally define 
      the semantics of over 20 000 terms with axioms to correctly denote various modes 
      of action (MoA). Based on an integration of public data, we have automatically 
      assigned over a thousand of approved drugs into these MoA categories. The 
      resulting new resource is called the Functional Therapeutic Chemical 
      Classification System and was further evaluated against the content of the 
      traditional Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System. We illustrate 
      how the new classification can be used to generate drug repurposing hypotheses, 
      using Alzheimers disease as a use-case. AVAILABILITY:

TI  - Repurposing beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonists for Alzheimer's disease: 
      beneficial effects in a mouse model.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.1186/s13195-021-00842-3 [doi]
LID - 103
AB  - BACKGROUND: Old age, the most important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      is associated with thermoregulatory deficits. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is the 
      main thermogenic driver in mammals and its stimulation, through β3 adrenergic 
      receptor (β3AR) agonists or cold acclimation, counteracts metabolic deficits in 
      rodents and humans. Studies in animal models show that AD neuropathology leads to 
      thermoregulatory deficits, and cold-induced tau hyperphosphorylation is prevented 
      by BAT stimulation through cold acclimation. Since metabolic disorders and AD 
      share strong pathogenic links, we hypothesized that BAT stimulation through a 
      β3AR agonist could exert benefits in AD as well. METHODS: CL-316,243, a specific 
      β3AR agonist, was administered to the triple transgenic mouse model of AD 
      (3xTg-AD) and non-transgenic controls from 15 to 16 months of age at a dose of 
      1 mg/kg/day i.p. RESULTS: Here, we show that β3AR agonist administration 
      decreased body weight and improved peripheral glucose metabolism and BAT 
      thermogenesis in both non-transgenic and 3xTg-AD mice. One-month treatment with a 
      β3AR agonist increased recognition index by 19% in 16-month-old 3xTg-AD mice 
      compared to pre-treatment (14-month-old). Locomotion, anxiety, and tau pathology 
      were not modified. Finally, insoluble Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was decreased by 27% in the 
      hippocampus of CL-316,243-injected 3xTg-AD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our 
      results indicate that β3AR stimulation reverses memory deficits and shifts 
      downward the insoluble Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in 16-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. As β3AR 
      agonists are being clinically developed for metabolic disorders, repurposing them 
      in AD could be a valuable therapeutic strategy.

TI  - PharmKG: a dedicated knowledge graph benchmark for bomedical data mining.
LID - bbaa344 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbaa344 [doi]
AB  - Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), which can help with the understanding of 
      complex biological systems and pathologies, have begun to play a critical role in 
      medical practice and research. However, challenges remain in their embedding and 
      use due to their complex nature and the specific demands of their construction. 
      Existing studies often suffer from problems such as sparse and noisy datasets, 
      insufficient modeling methods and non-uniform evaluation metrics. In this work, 
      we established a comprehensive KG system for the biomedical field in an attempt 
      to bridge the gap. Here, we introduced PharmKG, a multi-relational, attributed 
      biomedical KG, composed of more than 500 000 individual interconnections between 
      genes, drugs and diseases, with 29 relation types over a vocabulary of ~8000 
      disambiguated entities. Each entity in PharmKG is attached with heterogeneous, 
      domain-specific information obtained from multi-omics data, i.e. gene expression, 
      chemical structure and disease word embedding, while preserving the semantic and 
      biomedical features. For baselines, we offered nine state-of-the-art KG embedding 
      (KGE) approaches and a new biological, intuitive, graph neural network-based KGE 
      method that uses a combination of both global network structure and heterogeneous 
      domain features. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conducted extensive 
      experiments to assess these KGE models using multiple evaluation metrics. 
      Finally, we discussed our observations across various downstream biological tasks 
      and provide insights and guidelines for how to use a KG in biomedicine. We hope 
      that the unprecedented quality and diversity of PharmKG will lead to advances in 
      biomedical KG construction, embedding and application.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and 
      Huntington's disease manifest with the neuronal accumulation of toxic proteins. 
      Since autophagy upregulation enhances the clearance of such proteins and 
      ameliorates their toxicities in animal models, we and others have sought to 
      re-position/re-profile existing compounds used in humans to identify those that 
      may induce autophagy in the brain. A key challenge with this approach is to 
      assess if any hits identified can induce neuronal autophagy at concentrations 
      that would be seen in humans taking the drug for its conventional indication. 
      Here we report that felodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker and 
      anti-hypertensive drug, induces autophagy and clears diverse aggregate-prone, 
      neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins. Felodipine can clear mutant 
      α-synuclein in mouse brains at plasma concentrations similar to those that would 
      be seen in humans taking the drug. This is associated with neuroprotection in 
      mice, suggesting the promise of this compound for use in neurodegeneration.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease are complex to tackle 
      because of the complexity of the brain, both in structure and function. Such 
      complexity is reflected by the involvement of various brain regions and multiple 
      pathways in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases that render single drug 
      target approaches ineffective. Particularly in the area of neurodegeneration, 
      attention has been drawn to repurposing existing drugs with proven efficacy and 
      safety profiles. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the brain 
      chemical space to predict the feasibility of repurposing strategies. Using a 
      mechanism-based, drug-target interaction modeling approach, we have identified 
      promising drug candidates for repositioning. Mechanistic cause-and-effect models 
      consolidate relevant prior knowledge on drugs, targets, and pathways from the 
      scientific literature and integrate insights derived from experimental data. We 
      demonstrate the power of this approach by predicting two repositioning candidates 
      for Alzheimer's disease and one for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

      Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative condition. In order to 
      treat AD, the use of a "drug repositioning" or "repurposing" approach with 
      potential disease-modifying compounds has been increased. The new generation 
      antipsychotics are commonly used in AD and other dementias for the treatment of 
      psychosis and behavioral symptoms, and several animal models have shown the 
      effects of these potential disease-modifying compounds. In this study, we 
      examined whether long-term clozapine treatment could reduce amyloid beta (Aβ) 
      deposition and cognitive impairment in transgenic mice of AD, Tg-APPswe/PS1dE9. 
      AD mice were fed clozapine at 20 mg/kg/day for 3 months from 4.5 months of age. 
      Intake of clozapine improved the Aβ-induced memory impairment and suppressed Aβ 
      levels and plaque deposition in the brain of AD mice. Clozapine upregulated Trk, 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cyclin-dependent kinase-5, and p35 in the 
      cortex and hippocampus of AD mice and activated AMP-activated protein kinase 
      (AMPK). As a downstream effector of AMPK, beta-secretase expression was decreased 
      by clozapine administration. Moreover, clozapine-phosphorylated synapsin I at 
      Ser9 and Ser549 sites in the hippocampus and cortex of AD mice, which may be 
      involved in synaptic strength. This study suggests that as one of candidate for 
      multi-target approach of AD treatment, clozapine is proposed as a therapeutic 
      drug for treatment of AD patients.

AB  - The interrelation of cancer and Alzheimer's disorder (AD)-associated molecular 
      mechanisms, reported last decade, paved the path for drug discoveries. In this 
      direction, while chemotherapy is well established for breast cancer (BC), the 
      detection and targeted therapy for AD is not advanced due to a lack of recognized 
      peripheral biomarkers. The present study aimed to find diagnostic and prognostic 
      molecular signature markers common to both BC and AD for possible drug targeting 
      and repurposing. For these disorders, two corresponding microarray datasets 
      (GSE42568, GSE33000) were used for identifying the differentially expressed genes 
      (DEGs), resulting in recognition of CD209 and MCM7 as the two common players. 
      While the CD209 gene was upregulated in both disorders and has been studied 
      vastly, the MCM7 gene showed a strikingly reverse pattern of expression level, 
      downregulated in the case of BC while upregulated in the case of AD. Thus, the 
      MCM7 gene was further analyzed for expression, predictions, and validations of 
      its structure and protein-protein interaction (PPI) for the possible development 
      of new treatment methods for AD. The study concluded with indicative drug 
      repurposing studies to check the effect of existing clinically approved drugs for 
      BC for rectifying the expression levels of the mutated MCM7 gene in AD.

TI  - deepDR: a network-based deep learning approach to in silico drug repositioning.
PG  - 5191-5198
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz418 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Traditional drug discovery and development are often time-consuming 
      and high risk. Repurposing/repositioning of approved drugs offers a relatively 
      low-cost and high-efficiency approach toward rapid development of efficacious 
      treatments. The emergence of large-scale, heterogeneous biological networks has 
      offered unprecedented opportunities for developing in silico drug repositioning 
      approaches. However, capturing highly non-linear, heterogeneous network 
      structures by most existing approaches for drug repositioning has been 
      challenging. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a network-based deep-learning 
      approach, termed deepDR, for in silico drug repurposing by integrating 10 
      networks: one drug-disease, one drug-side-effect, one drug-target and seven 
      drug-drug networks. Specifically, deepDR learns high-level features of drugs from 
      the heterogeneous networks by a multi-modal deep autoencoder. Then the learned 
      low-dimensional representation of drugs together with clinically reported 
      drug-disease pairs are encoded and decoded collectively via a variational 
      autoencoder to infer candidates for approved drugs for which they were not 
      originally approved. We found that deepDR revealed high performance [the area 
      under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.908], outperforming 
      conventional network-based or machine learning-based approaches. Importantly, 
      deepDR-predicted drug-disease associations were validated by the

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent DNA/RNA sequencing and other multi-omics technologies have 
      advanced the understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of AD, yet there is 
      still a lack of disease-modifying treatments for AD. A new approach to 
      integration of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and human interactome in the 
      drug discovery and development process is essential for this endeavor. METHODS: 
      In this study, we developed AlzGPS (Genome-wide Positioning Systems platform for 
      Alzheimer's Drug Discovery, https://alzgps.lerner.ccf.org ), a comprehensive 
      systems biology tool to enable searching, visualizing, and analyzing multi-omics, 
      various types of heterogeneous biological networks, and clinical databases for 
      target identification and development of effective prevention and treatment for 
      AD. RESULTS: Via AlzGPS: (1) we curated more than 100 AD multi-omics data sets 
      capturing DNA, RNA, protein, and small molecule profiles underlying AD 
      pathogenesis (e.g., early vs. late stage and tau or amyloid endophenotype); (2) 
      we constructed endophenotype disease modules by incorporating multi-omics 
      findings and human protein-protein interactome networks; (3) we provided possible 
      treatment information from ~ 3000 FDA approved/investigational drugs for AD using 
      state-of-the-art network proximity analyses; (4) we curated nearly 300 literature 
      references for high-confidence drug candidates; (5) we included information from 
      over 1000 AD clinical trials noting drug's mechanisms-of-action and primary drug 
      targets, and linking them to our integrated multi-omics view for targets and 
      network analysis results for the drugs; (6) we implemented a highly interactive 
      web interface for database browsing and network visualization. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Network visualization enabled by AlzGPS includes brain-specific neighborhood 
      networks for genes-of-interest, endophenotype disease module networks for 
      omics-of-interest, and mechanism-of-action networks for drugs targeting disease 
      modules. By virtue of combining systems pharmacology and network-based 
      integrative analysis of multi-omics data, AlzGPS offers actionable systems 
      biology tools for accelerating therapeutic development in AD.

TI  - Unraveling the intercellular communication disruption and key pathways in 
      Alzheimer's disease: An integrative study of single-nucleus transcriptomes and 
      genetic association.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) analyses have revealed 
      important cellular and functional features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a 
      prevalent neurodegenerative disease. However, our knowledge regarding 
      intercellular communication mediated by dysregulated ligand-receptor (LR) 
      interactions remains very limited in AD brains. METHODS: We systematically 
      assessed the intercellular communication networks by using a discovery snRNA-seq 
      dataset comprising 69,499 nuclei from 48 human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
      samples. We replicated the findings using an independent snRNA-seq dataset of 
      56,440 nuclei from 18 PFC samples. By integrating genetic signals from AD 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics and whole genome 
      sequencing (WGS) data, we prioritized AD-associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms 
      containing dysregulated LR interactions. We further explored drug repurposing for 
      the prioritized LR pairs using the Therapeutic Targets Database. RESULTS: We 
      identified 316 dysregulated LR interactions across six major cell types in AD 
      PFC, of which 210 pairs were replicated. Among the replicated LR signals, we 
      found globally downregulated communications in astrocytes-to-neurons signaling 
      axis, characterized, for instance, by the downregulation of APOE-related and 
      Calmodulin (CALM)-related LR interactions and their potential regulatory 
      connections to target genes. Pathway analyses revealed 60 GO terms significantly 
      linked to AD, highlighting Biological Processes such as 'amyloid precursor 
      protein processing' and 'ion transmembrane transport', among others. We 
      prioritized several drug repurposing candidates, such as cromoglicate, targeting 
      the identified dysregulated LR pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrative analysis 
      identified key dysregulated LR interactions in a cell type-specific manner and 
      the associated GO terms in AD, offering novel insights into potential therapeutic 
      targets involved in disrupted cell-cell communication in AD.

      RNA-Protein Interaction.
PG  - 2277-2285
LID - 10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00214 [doi]
AB  - Neurofibrillary tangles composed of aberrantly aggregating tau protein are a 
      hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia disorders. Recent work has 
      shown that mammalian suppressor of tauopathy 2 (MSUT2), also named ZC3H14 (Zinc 
      Finger CCCH-Type Containing 14), controls accumulation of pathological tau in 
      cultured human cells and mice. Knocking out MSUT2 protects neurons from 
      neurodegenerative tauopathy and preserves learning and memory. MSUT2 protein 
      functions to bind polyadenosine [poly(A)] tails of mRNA through its C-terminal 
      CCCH type zinc finger domains, and loss of CCCH domain function suppresses 
      tauopathy in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice. Thus, we hypothesized that 
      inhibiting the poly(A):MSUT2 RNA-protein interaction would ameliorate 
      pathological tau accumulation. Here we present a high-throughput screening method 
      for the identification of small molecules inhibiting the poly(A):MSUT2 
      RNA-protein interaction. We employed a fluorescent polarization assay for initial 
      small molecule discovery with the intention to repurpose hits identified from the 
      NIH Clinical Collection (NIHCC). Our drug repurposing development workflow 
      included validation of hits by dose-response analysis, specificity testing, 
      orthogonal assays of activity, and cytotoxicity. Validated compounds passing 
      through this screening funnel will be evaluated for translational effectiveness 
      in future studies. This preclinical drug development pipeline identified diverse 
      FDA approved drugs duloxetine, saquinavir, and clofazimine as potential 
      repurposing candidates for reducing pathological tau accumulation.

AB  - Through drug discovery strategies of repurposing and redeveloping existing drugs, 
      a series of novel tadalafil derivatives were rationally designed, synthesized, 
      and evaluated to seek dual-target AChE/PDE5 inhibitors as good candidate drugs 
      for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among these derivatives, 1p and 1w exhibited 
      excellent selective dual-target AChE/PDE5 inhibitory activities and improved 
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrability. Importantly, 1w·Cit (citrate of 1w) 
      could reverse the cognitive dysfunction of scopolamine-induced AD mice and 
      exhibited an excellent effect on enhancing cAMP response element-binding protein 
      (CREB) phosphorylation in vivo, a crucial factor in memory formation and synaptic 
      plasticity. Moreover, the molecular docking simulations of 1w with hAChE and 
      hPDE5A confirmed that our design strategy was rational. In summary, our research 
      provides a potential selective dual-target AChE/PDE5 inhibitor as a good 
      candidate drug for the treatment of AD, and it could also be regarded as a small 
      molecule probe to validate the novel AD therapeutic approach in vivo.

AB  - Drug repurposing represents an attractive alternative to the costly and 
      time-consuming process of new drug development, particularly for serious, 
      widespread conditions with limited effective treatments, such as Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). Emerging generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies like 
      ChatGPT offer the promise of expediting the review and summary of scientific 
      knowledge. To examine the feasibility of using GAI for identifying drug 
      repurposing candidates, we iteratively tasked ChatGPT with proposing the twenty 
      most promising drugs for repurposing in AD, and tested the top ten for risk of 
      incident AD in exposed and unexposed individuals over age 65 in two large 
      clinical datasets: 1) Vanderbilt University Medical Center and 2) the All of Us 
      Research Program. Among the candidates suggested by ChatGPT, metformin, 
      simvastatin, and losartan were associated with lower AD risk in meta-analysis. 
      These findings suggest GAI technologies can assimilate scientific insights from 
      an extensive Internet-based search space, helping to prioritize drug repurposing 
      candidates and facilitate the treatment of diseases.

AB  - In the process of drug development, in vitro studies do not always adequately 
      predict human-specific drug responsiveness in clinical trials. Here, we applied 
      the advantage of human iPSC-derived neurons, which offer human-specific drug 
      responsiveness, to screen and evaluate therapeutic candidates for Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). Using AD patient neurons with nearly 100% purity from iPSCs, we 
      established a robust and reproducible assay for amyloid β peptide (Aβ), a 
      pathogenic molecule in AD, and screened a pharmaceutical compound library. 
      We acquired 27 Aβ-lowering screen hits, prioritized hits by chemical 
      structure-based clustering, and selected 6 leading compounds. Next, to maximize 
      the anti-Aβ effect, we selected a synergistic combination of bromocriptine, 
      cromolyn, and topiramate as an anti-Aβ cocktail. Finally, using neurons from 
      familial and sporadic AD patients, we found that the cocktail showed a 
      significant and potent anti-Aβ effect on patient cells. This human iPSC-based 
      platform promises to be useful for AD drug development.

TI  - The case of galantamine: repurposing and late blooming of a cholinergic drug.
PG  - FSO73
LID - 10.4155/fso.15.73 [doi]
LID - FSO73
AB  - Galantamine is a reversible inhibitor of cholinesterases and an allosteric 
      modulator of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors which restores reduced 
      cholinergic tone in the central and peripheral nervous system. Characterized in 
      the early 1950s in Bulgaria, it saw limited use for paralytic and neuropathic 
      conditions until the cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease opened totally 
      new perspectives for its utility. Although constricted supplies at extremely high 
      prices and a fragmented patent situation made its repurposing challenging, 
      galantamine was globally launched as an Alzheimer's disease drug in 2000. Many 
      other possible uses have been clinically investigated, and might yet develop into 
      another drug career. This case study is presented as an example for classical 
      on-target drug repurposing and the challenges that such a project can face.

AB  - Novel drug development is onerous, time consuming and overpriced process with 
      particularly low success and relatively high enfeebling rates. To overcome this 
      burden, drug repositioning approach is being used to predict the possible 
      therapeutic effects of FDA approved drugs in different diseases. Herein, we 
      designed a computational and enzyme inhibitory mechanistic approach to fetch the 
      promising drugs from the pool of FDA approved drugs against AD. The binding 
      interaction patterns and conformations of screened drugs within active region of 
      AChE were confirmed through molecular docking profiles. The possible associations 
      of selected drugs with AD genes were predicted by pharmacogenomics analysis and 
      confirmed through data mining. The stability behaviour of docked complexes 
      (Drugs-AChE) were checked by MD simulations. The possible therapeutic potential 
      of repositioned drugs against AChE were checked by in vitro analysis. Taken 
      together, Cinitapride displayed a comparable results with standard and can be 
      used as possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of AD.

TI  - Potential repurposing of oncology drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 82
LID - 10.1186/1741-7015-11-82 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia, 
      affecting about 30 million people worldwide. Despite recent advances in 
      understanding its molecular pathology, no mechanism-based drugs are currently 
      available that can halt the progression of AD. Because amyloid-β-peptide (Aβ), a 
      primary component of senile plaques, is thought to be a central pathogenic 
      culprit, several disease-modifying therapies are being developed, including 
      inhibitors of Aβ-producing proteases and immunotherapies with anti-Aβ antibodies. 
      Drug repositioning or repurposing is regarded as a complementary and reasonable 
      approach to identify new drug candidates for AD. This commentary will discuss the 
      clinical relevance of an attractive candidate compound reported in a recent paper 
      by Hayes et al. (BMC Medicine 2013) as well as perspectives regarding the 
      possible repositioning of oncology drugs for the treatment of AD. See related 
      research article here http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/81.

TI  - Selective COX-2 Inhibitors: Road from Success to Controversy and the Quest for 
      Repurposing.
LID - 10.3390/ph15070827 [doi]
LID - 827
AB  - The introduction of selective COX-2 inhibitors (so-called 'coxibs') has 
      demonstrated tremendous commercial success due to their claimed lower potential 
      of serious gastrointestinal adverse effects than traditional NSAIDs. However, 
      following the repeated questioning on safety concerns, the coxibs 'controversial 
      me-too' saga increased substantially, inferring to the risk of cardiovascular 
      complications, subsequently leading to the voluntary withdrawal of coxibs (e.g., 
      rofecoxib and valdecoxib) from the market. For instance, the makers (Pfizer and 
      Merck) had to allegedly settle individual claims of cardiovascular hazards from 
      celecoxib and valdecoxib. Undoubtedly, the lessons drawn from this saga revealed 
      the flaws in drug surveillance and regulation, and taught science to pursue a 
      more integrated translational approach for data acquisition and interpretation, 
      prompting science-based strategies of risk avoidance in order to sustain the 
      value of such drugs, rather than their withdrawal. Looking forward, coxibs are 
      now being studied for repurposing, given their possible implications in the 
      management of a myriad of diseases, including cancer, epilepsy, psychiatric 
      disorders, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and so on. This article briefly 
      summarizes the development of COX-2 inhibitors to their market impression, 
      followed by the controversy related to their toxicity. In addition, the events 
      recollected in hindsight (the past lessons), the optimistic step towards drug 
      repurposing (the present), and the potential for forthcoming success (the future) 
      are also discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes a neural loss in histology of 
      brain with involvement of complex genomic and environmental factors. Accumulation 
      of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide and phosphorylated tau are indicative of progression 
      and cognitive decline. Hence an understanding of the underlying biological 
      pathways and targets along with associated mechanisms would be useful for the 
      development of improved therapeutics for treating AD. In the present work, we aim 
      to identify concealed targets for developing first line therapeutics and 
      repositioning of validated targets as well as FDA- approved drugs using a system 
      biology approach. METHODS: We have collated information pertaining to the 
      biological targets as well as the approved drugs, from scientific literature and 
      patents. RESULTS: In all, the imbalance in the functioning of around 79 proteins 
      and genes were identified to be involved in Alzheimer's cascade. Amongst them, 
      around 21 targets were found to be under therapeutic consideration for AD. Of the 
      remaining, around 17 targets were reported as potential targets for AD, although 
      they are under researcher's attention for other physio-pathological conditions. 
      The analysis further revealed that ˜41 therapeutic targets are pharmacologically 
      concealed but structurally validated targets and may constitute as potential 
      therapeutic candidate for future drug discovery for AD. CONCLUSION: The 
      biological pathway vs. drug mapping provides a complete overview about underlying 
      biological pathways, therapeutic targets (explored and concealed), associated 
      mechanisms, existing therapeutics and the information pertaining to molecules 
      currently under active drug development for further drug discovery and drug 
      re-positioning/repurposing approaches for AD management.

AB  - Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction reduces the cost and time of drug 
      development, and plays a vital role in drug discovery. However, most of research 
      does not fully explore the molecular structures of drug compounds in DTI 
      prediction. To this end, we propose a deep learning model to capture the 
      molecular structure information of drug compounds for DTI prediction. This model 
      utilizes a transformer network incorporating multilayer graph information, which 
      captures the features of a drug's molecular structure so that the interactions 
      between atoms of drug compounds can be explored more deeply. At the same time, a 
      convolutional neural network is employed to capture the local residue information 
      in the target sequence, and effectively extract the feature information of the 
      target. The experiments on the DrugBank dataset showed that the proposed model 
      outperformed previous models based on the structure of target sequences. The 
      results indicate that the improved transformer network fuses the feature 
      information between layers in the graph convolutional neural network and extracts 
      the interaction data for the molecular structure. The drug repositioning 
      experiment on COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease demonstrated the proposed model's 
      ability to find therapeutic drugs in drug discovery. The code of our model is 
      available at https://github.com/zhangpl109/DeepMGT-DTI.

      Mendelian randomization study.
PG  - 1132-1140
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyz155 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence concerning the potential repurposing of antihypertensives 
      for Alzheimer's disease prevention is inconclusive. We used Mendelian 
      randomization, which can be more robust to confounding by indication and patient 
      characteristics, to investigate the effects of lowering systolic blood pressure, 
      via the protein targets of different antihypertensive drug classes, on 
      Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We used summary statistics from genome-wide 
      association studies of systolic blood pressure and Alzheimer's disease in a 
      two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. We identified single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) that mimic the action of antihypertensive protein targets 
      and estimated the effect of lowering systolic blood pressure on Alzheimer's 
      disease in three ways: (i) combining the protein targets of antihypertensive drug 
      classes, (ii) combining all protein targets and (iii) without consideration of 
      the protein targets. RESULTS: There was limited evidence that lowering systolic 
      blood pressure, via the protein targets of antihypertensive drug classes, 
      affected Alzheimer's disease risk. For example, the protein targets of calcium 
      channel blockers had an odds ratio (OR) per 10 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure 
      of 1.53 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94 to 2.49; p = 0.09; SNPs = 17]. We 
      also found limited evidence for an effect when combining all protein targets (OR 
      per 10 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.56; p = 0.41; 
      SNPs = 59) and without consideration of the protein targets (OR per 10 mmHg lower 
      systolic blood pressure: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.13; p = 0.45; SNPs = 153). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization suggests that lowering systolic blood 
      pressure via the protein targets of antihypertensive drugs is unlikely to affect 
      the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, if specific 
      antihypertensive drug classes do affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease, they may 
      not do so via systolic blood pressure.

AB  - Six drugs (dapsone, diltiazem, timolol, rosiglitazone, mesalazine, and 
      milnacipran) that were predicted by network-based polypharmacology approaches as 
      potential anti-Alzheimer's drugs, have been subjected in this study for in silico 
      and in vitro evaluation to check their potential against protein fibrillation, 
      which is a causative factor for multiple diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, 
      Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease, cardiac myopathy, type-II diabetes 
      mellitus and many others. Molecular docking and thereafter molecular dynamics 
      (MD) simulations revealed that diltiazem, rosiglitazone, and milnacipran interact 
      with the binding residues such as Asp52, Glu35, Trp62, and Asp101, which lie 
      within the fibrillating region of HEWL. The MM-GBSA analysis revealed -7.86, 
      -5.05, and -10.29 kcal/mol as the binding energy of diltiazem, rosiglitazone, and 
      milnacipran. The RMSD and RMSF calculations revealed significant stabilities of 
      these ligands within the binding pocket of HEWL. While compared with two reported 
      ligands inhibiting HEWL fibrillation, milnacipran depicted almost similar binding 
      potential with one of the known ligands (Ligand binding affinity -10.66 kcal/mol) 
      of HEWL. Furthermore, secondary structure analyses revealed notable inhibition of 
      the secondary structural changes with our candidate ligand; especially regarding 
      retention of the 3/10 α-helix both by DSSP simulation, Circular dichroism, and 
      FESEM-based microscopic image analyses. Taking further into experimental 
      validation, all three ligands inhibited fibrillation in HEWL in simulated 
      conditions as revealed by blue shift in Congo red assay and later expressing 
      percentage inhibition in ThioflavinT assay as well. However, dose-dependent 
      kinetics revealed that the antifibrillatory effects of drugs are more pronounced 
      at low protein concentrations.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

TI  - Identification of Celecoxib-Targeted Proteins Using Label-Free Thermal Proteome 
      Profiling on Rat Hippocampus.
PG  - 308-318
LID - 10.1124/molpharm.120.000210 [doi]
AB  - Celecoxib, or Celebrex, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is one of the most 
      common medicines for treating inflammatory diseases. Recently, it has been shown 
      that celecoxib is associated with implications in complex diseases, such as 
      Alzheimer disease and cancer as well as with cardiovascular risk assessment and 
      toxicity, suggesting that celecoxib may affect multiple unknown targets. In this 
      project, we detected targets of celecoxib within the nervous system using a 
      label-free thermal proteome profiling method. First, proteins of the rat 
      hippocampus were treated with multiple drug concentrations and temperatures. 
      Next, we separated the soluble proteins from the denatured and sedimented total 
      protein load by ultracentrifugation. Subsequently, the soluble proteins were 
      analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine the 
      identity of the celecoxib-targeted proteins based on structural changes by 
      thermal stability variation of targeted proteins toward higher solubility in the 
      higher temperatures. In the analysis of the soluble protein extract at 67°C, 44 
      proteins were uniquely detected in drug-treated samples out of all 478 identified 
      proteins at this temperature. Ras-associated binding protein 4a, 1 out of these 
      44 proteins, has previously been reported as one of the celecoxib off targets in 
      the rat central nervous system. Furthermore, we provide more molecular details 
      through biomedical enrichment analysis to explore the potential role of all 
      detected proteins in the biologic systems. We show that the determined proteins 
      play a role in the signaling pathways related to neurodegenerative disease-and 
      cancer pathways. Finally, we fill out molecular supporting evidence for using 
      celecoxib toward the drug-repurposing approach by exploring drug targets. 
      SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study determined 44 off-target proteins of 
      celecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and one of the most common medicines 
      for treating inflammatory diseases. It shows that these proteins play a role in 
      the signaling pathways related to neurodegenerative disease and cancer pathways. 
      Finally, the study provides molecular supporting evidence for using celecoxib 
      toward the drug-repurposing approach by exploring drug targets.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common neurodegenerative disorder, 
      with 47 million affected people worldwide. Current treatment strategies are aimed 
      at reducing the symptoms and do slow down the progression of the disease, but 
      inevitably fail in the long-term. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived 
      neuronal cells from AD patients have proven to be a reliable model for AD 
      pathogenesis. Here, we have conducted an in silico analysis aimed at identifying 
      pathogenic gene-expression profiles and novel drug candidates. The GSE117589 
      microarray dataset was used for the identification of Differentially Expressed 
      Genes (DEGs) between iPSC-derived neuronal progenitor (NP) cells and neurons from 
      AD patients and healthy donors. The Discriminant Analysis Module (DAM) algorithm 
      was used for the identification of biomarkers of disease. Drugs with 
      anti-signature gene perturbation profiles were identified using the L1000FWD 
      software. DAM analysis was used to identify a list of potential biomarkers among 
      the DEGs, able to discriminate AD patients from healthy people. Finally, 
      anti-signature perturbation analysis identified potential anti-AD drugs. This 
      study set the basis for the investigation of potential novel pharmacological 
      strategies for AD. Furthermore, a subset of genes for the early diagnosis of AD 
      is proposed.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) pose a significant 
      global health challenge that requires the exploration of innovative therapeutic 
      strategies. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) is one of 
      the critical proteins involved in immune regulation and neuroinflammation. It has 
      emerged as a promising therapeutic target to develop treatments for 
      neurodegenerative disorders like AD. Here, we employed a comprehensive virtual 
      screening approach to identify potential small molecule inhibitors among 
      FDA-approved drugs for TREM2. The docking study reveals significant binding 
      affinity, ranging from -7.8 kcal/mol to -8.5 kcal/mol, for the elucidated hits 
      against TREM2, accompanied by several crucial interactions. Among the repurposed 
      drugs identified in the initial screening, Carpipramine, Clocapramine, and 
      Pimozide stood out due to their notable binding potential and favorable drug 
      profiling. Further, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the 
      selected molecules that probed their structural dynamics and stability within the 
      TREM2 binding pocket. The structural parameters and hydrogen bond dynamics 
      remained remarkably stable throughout the simulated trajectories. Furthermore, we 
      performed principal component analysis (PCA) and constructed free energy 
      landscapes (FELs) to gain deeper insights into ligand binding and conformational 
      flexibility of TREM2. The findings revealed that the elucidated molecules, 
      Carpipramine, Clocapramine, and Pimozide, exhibited an exceptional fit within the 
      binding pocket of TREM2 with remarkable stability and interaction patterns 
      throughout the 500 ns simulation window. Interestingly, these molecules possessed 
      a spectrum of anti-neurodegenerative properties and favorable drug profiles, 
      which suggest their potential as promising drug candidates for repurposing in the 
      treatment of AD.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the main causes of dementia, is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder. Cholinesterase inhibitors are used in the treatment 
      of AD, but prolonged use of these drugs can lead to serious side effects. Drug 
      repurposing is an approach that aims to reveal the effectiveness of drugs in 
      different diseases beyond their clinical uses. In this work, we investigated in 
      vitro and in silico inhibitory effects of 11 different drugs on cholinesterases. 
      The results showed that trimebutine, theophylline, and levamisole had the highest 
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitory actions among the tested drugs, and these drugs 
      inhibited by 68.70 ± 0.46, 53.25 ± 3.40, and 44.03 ± 1.20%, respectively at 
      1000 µM. In addition, these drugs are bound to acetylcholinesterase via 
      competitive manner. Molecular modeling predicted good fitness in 
      acetylcholinesterase active site for these drugs and possible central nervous 
      system action for trimebutine. All of these results demonstrated that trimebutine 
      was determined to be the drug with the highest potential for use in AD.

      a Bioinformatics Analysis.

LID - 1731
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurologic disorder causing brain atrophy and the 
      death of brain cells. It is a progressive condition marked by cognitive and 
      behavioral impairment that significantly interferes with daily activities. AD 
      symptoms develop gradually over many years and eventually become more severe, and 
      no cure has been found yet to arrest this process. The present study is directed 
      towards suggesting putative novel solutions and paradigms for fighting AD 
      pathogenesis by exploiting new insights from network medicine and drug 
      repurposing strategies. To identify new drug-AD associations, we exploited 
      SAveRUNNER, a recently developed network-based algorithm for drug repurposing, 
      which quantifies the vicinity of disease-associated genes to drug targets in the 
      human interactome. We complemented the analysis with an in silico validation of 
      the candidate compounds through a gene set enrichment analysis, aiming to 
      determine if the modulation of the gene expression induced by the predicted drugs 
      could be counteracted by the modulation elicited by the disease. We identified 
      some interesting compounds belonging to the beta-blocker family, originally 
      approved for treating hypertension, such as betaxolol, bisoprolol, and 
      metoprolol, whose connection with a lower risk to develop Alzheimer's disease has 
      already been observed. Moreover, our algorithm predicted multi-kinase inhibitors 
      such as regorafenib, whose beneficial effects were recently investigated for 
      neuroinflammation and AD pathology, and mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus, whose 
      modulation has been associated with AD.

TI  - Multi-Layer Picture of Neurodegenerative Diseases: Lessons from the Use of Big 
      Data through Artificial Intelligence.
LID - 10.3390/jpm11040280 [doi]
LID - 280
AB  - In the big data era, artificial intelligence techniques have been applied to 
      tackle traditional issues in the study of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the 
      progress made in understanding the complex (epi)genetics signatures underlying 
      neurodegenerative disorders, performing early diagnosis and developing drug 
      repurposing strategies remain serious challenges for such conditions. In this 
      context, the integration of multi-omics, neuroimaging, and electronic health 
      records data can be exploited using deep learning methods to provide the most 
      accurate representation of patients possible. Deep learning allows researchers to 
      find multi-modal biomarkers to develop more effective and personalized 
      treatments, early diagnosis tools, as well as useful information for drug 
      discovering and repurposing in neurodegenerative pathologies. In this review, we 
      will describe how relevant studies have been able to demonstrate the potential of 
      deep learning to enhance the knowledge of neurodegenerative disorders such as 
      Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases through the integration of all sources of 
      biomedical data.

TI  - Unsupervised Machine Learning to Identify Separable Clinical Alzheimer's Disease 
      Sub-Populations.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11080977 [doi]
LID - 977
AB  - Heterogeneity among Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients confounds clinical trial 
      patient selection and therapeutic efficacy evaluation. This work defines 
      separable AD clinical sub-populations using unsupervised machine learning. 
      Clustering (t-SNE followed by k-means) of patient features and association rule 
      mining (ARM) was performed on the ADNIMERGE dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease 
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Patient sociodemographics, brain imaging, 
      biomarkers, cognitive tests, and medication usage were included for analysis. 
      Four AD clinical sub-populations were identified using between-cluster mean fold 
      changes [cognitive performance, brain volume]: cluster-1 represented least severe 
      disease [+17.3, +13.3]; cluster-0 [-4.6, +3.8] and cluster-3 [+10.8, -4.9] 
      represented mid-severity sub-populations; cluster-2 represented most severe 
      disease [-18.4, -8.4]. ARM assessed frequently occurring pharmacologic substances 
      within the 4 sub-populations. No drug class was associated with the least severe 
      AD (cluster-1), likely due to lesser antecedent disease. Anti-hyperlipidemia 
      drugs associated with cluster-0 (mid-severity, higher volume). Interestingly, 
      antioxidants vitamin C and E associated with cluster-3 (mid-severity, higher 
      cognition). Anti-depressants like Zoloft associated with most severe disease 
      (cluster-2). Vitamin D is protective for AD, but ARM identified significant 
      underutilization across all AD sub-populations. Identification and feature 
      characterization of four distinct AD sub-population "clusters" using standard 
      clinical features enhances future clinical trial selection criteria and 
      cross-study comparative analysis.

TI  - Repurposing ibuprofen-loaded microemulsion for the management of Alzheimer's 
      disease: evidence of potential intranasal brain targeting.
PG  - 1188-1203
LID - 10.1080/10717544.2021.1937383 [doi]
AB  - Studies have shown the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as 
      ibuprofen could reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The drug-repurposing 
      strategy offers a bright opportunity for these patients. Intranasal 
      administration through the olfactory pathway provides noninvasive and direct drug 
      delivery to the target brain. A novel ibuprofen microemulsion was prepared, 
      characterized and assessed the brain uptake in rats. The solubility of ibuprofen 
      in various oils, surfactants, co-surfactants, and different ratios of 
      surfactant/co-surfactant mixtures was screened and the phase diagrams were 
      constructed. The colloidal particle size was 166.3 ± 2.55 nm and the zeta 
      potential was -22.7 mV. Conductivity and dilution test identified an O/W type 
      microemulsion with pH 4.09 ± 0.08. The rheological study showed a Newtonian flow 
      behavior with cP 10.633 ± 0.603 (mPa⋅s). A steady drug release and linear 
      permeation profiles were observed and showed a 90% permeation rate from the 
      released drug. Ibuprofen microemulsion showed excellent stability in 3-months 
      accelerated storage conditions, heating-cooling and freeze-thaw cycles, 
      accelerated centrifugation, and 6- and 12-months long-term storage conditions. In 
      vivo studies in rats further demonstrated a 4-fold higher brain uptake of 
      ibuprofen from the microemulsion compared to the reference solution and nearly 
      4-fold and 10-fold higher compared to the intravenous and oral administrations. 
      This study provides an exciting repurposing strategy and new administration route 
      for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Bleomycin modulates amyloid aggregation in β-amyloid and hIAPP.
PG  - 25929-25946
LID - 10.1039/d0ra04949b [doi]
AB  - Aberrant misfolding and amyloid aggregation, which result in amyloid fibrils, are 
      frequent and critical pathological incidents in various neurodegenerative 
      disorders. Multiple drugs or inhibitors have been investigated to avert amyloid 
      aggregation in individual peptides, exhibiting sequence-dependent inhibition 
      mechanisms. Establishing or inventing inhibitors capable of preventing amyloid 
      aggregation in a wide variety of amyloid peptides is quite a daunting task. 
      Bleomycin (BLM), a complex glycopeptide, has been widely used as an antibiotic 
      and antitumor drug due to its ability to inhibit DNA metabolism, and as an 
      antineoplastic, especially for solid tumors. In this study, we investigated the 
      dual inhibitory effects of BLM on Aβ aggregation, associated with Alzheimer's 
      disease and hIAPP, which is linked to type 2 diabetes, using both computational 
      and experimental techniques. Combined results from drug repurposing and replica 
      exchange molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that BLM binds to the β-sheet 
      region considered a hotspot for amyloid fibrils of Aβ and hIAPP. BLM was also 
      found to be involved in β-sheet destabilization and, ultimately, in its 
      reduction. Further, experimental validation through in vitro amyloid aggregation 
      assays was obtained wherein the fibrillar load was decreased for the BLM-treated 
      Aβ and hIAPP peptides in comparison to controls. For the first time, this study 
      shows that BLM is a dual inhibitor of Aβ and hIAPP amyloid aggregation. In the 
      future, the conformational optimization and processing of BLM may help develop 
      various efficient sequence-dependent inhibitors against amyloid aggregation in 
      various amyloid peptides.

AB  - The association between Alzheimer's disease and metabolic disorders as 
      significant risk factors is widely acknowledged. However, the intricate molecular 
      mechanism intertwining these conditions remains elusive. To address this 
      knowledge gap, we conducted a thorough investigation using a bioinformatics 
      method to illuminate the molecular connections and pathways that provide novel 
      perspectives on these disorders' pathological and clinical features. Microarray 
      datasets (GSE5281, GSE122063) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database 
      facilitated the way to identify genes with differential expression in Alzheimer's 
      disease (141 genes). Leveraging CoreMine, CTD, and Gene Card databases, we 
      extracted genes associated with metabolic conditions, including hypertension, 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and diabetes. Subsequent analysis uncovered 
      overlapping genes implicated in metabolic conditions and Alzheimer's disease, 
      revealing shared molecular links. We utilized String and HIPPIE databases to 
      visualize these shared genes' protein-protein interactions (PPI) and constructed 
      a PPI network using Cytoscape and MCODE plugin. SPP1, CD44, IGF1, and FLT1 were 
      identified as crucial molecules in the main cluster of Alzheimer's disease and 
      metabolic syndrome. Enrichment analysis by the DAVID dataset was employed and 
      highlighted the SPP1 as a novel target, with its receptor CD44 playing a 
      significant role in the inflammatory cascade and disruption of insulin signaling, 
      contributing to the neurodegenerative aspects of Alzheimer's disease. 
      ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, and the PI3K/Akt pathways may all 
      mediate these effects. Additionally, we investigated potential medications by 
      repurposing the molecular links using the DGIdb database, revealing Tacrolimus 
      and Calcitonin as promising candidates, particularly since they possess binding 
      sites on the SPP1 molecule. In conclusion, our study unveils crucial molecular 
      bridges between metabolic syndrome and AD, providing insights into their 
      pathophysiology for therapeutic interventions.

TI  - EKGDR: An End-to-End Knowledge Graph-Based Method for Computational Drug 
      Repurposing.
PG  - 1868-1881
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01925 [doi]
AB  - The lengthy and expensive process of developing new drugs from scratch, coupled 
      with a high failure rate, has prompted the emergence of drug 
      repurposing/repositioning as a more efficient and cost-effective approach. This 
      approach involves identifying new therapeutic applications for existing approved 
      drugs, leveraging the extensive drug-related data already gathered. However, the 
      diversity and heterogeneity of data, along with the limited availability of known 
      drug-disease interactions, pose significant challenges to computational drug 
      design. To address these challenges, this study introduces EKGDR, an end-to-end 
      knowledge graph-based approach for computational drug repurposing. EKGDR utilizes 
      the power of a drug knowledge graph, a comprehensive repository of drug-related 
      information that encompasses known drug interactions and various categorization 
      information, as well as structural molecular descriptors of drugs. EKGDR employs 
      graph neural networks, a cutting-edge graph representation learning technique, to 
      embed the drug knowledge graph (nodes and relations) in an end-to-end manner. By 
      doing so, EKGDR can effectively learn the underlying causes (intents) behind 
      drug-disease interactions and recursively aggregate and combine relational 
      messages between nodes along different multihop neighborhood paths (relational 
      paths). This process generates representations of disease and drug nodes, 
      enabling EKGDR to predict the interaction probability for each drug-disease pair 
      in an end-to-end manner. The obtained results demonstrate that EKGDR outperforms 
      previous models in all three evaluation metrics: area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUROC = 0.9475), area under the precision-recall 
      curve (AUPRC = 0.9490), and recall at the top-200 recommendations (Recall@200 = 
      0.8315). To further validate EKGDR's effectiveness, we evaluated the top-20 
      candidate drugs suggested for each of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

TI  - Chemoinformatics Analyses of Tau Ligands Reveal Key Molecular Requirements for 
      the Identification of Potential Drug Candidates against Tauopathies.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26165039 [doi]
LID - 5039
AB  - Tau is a highly soluble protein mainly localized at a cytoplasmic level in the 
      neuronal cells, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of microtubule 
      dynamic stability. Recent studies have demonstrated that several factors, such as 
      hyperphosphorylation or alterations of Tau metabolism, may contribute to the 
      pathological accumulation of protein aggregates, which can result in neuronal 
      death and the onset of a number of neurological disorders called Tauopathies. At 
      present, there are no available therapeutic remedies able to reduce Tau 
      aggregation, nor are there any structural clues or guidelines for the rational 
      identification of compounds preventing the accumulation of protein aggregates. To 
      help identify the structural properties required for anti-Tau aggregation 
      activity, we performed extensive chemoinformatics analyses on a dataset of Tau 
      ligands reported in ChEMBL. The performed analyses allowed us to identify a set 
      of molecular properties that are in common between known active ligands. 
      Moreover, extensive analyses of the fragment composition of reported ligands led 
      to the identification of chemical moieties and fragment combinations prevalent in 
      the more active compounds. Interestingly, many of these fragments were arranged 
      in recurring frameworks, some of which were clearly present in compounds 
      currently under clinical investigation. This work represents the first in-depth 
      chemoinformatics study of the molecular properties, constituting fragments and 
      similarity profiles, of known Tau aggregation inhibitors. The datasets of 
      compounds employed for the analyses, the identified molecular fragments and their 
      combinations are made publicly available as supplementary material.

TI  - Verapamil Prevents Development of Cognitive Impairment in an Aged Mouse Model of 
      Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 3374-3387

AB  - Currently, dementia is the only leading cause of death that is still on the rise, 
      with total costs already exceeding those of cancer and heart disease and 
      projected to increase even further in the coming years. Unfortunately, there are 
      no satisfactory treatments and attempts to develop novel, more effective 
      treatments have been extremely costly, albeit unsuccessful thus far. This has led 
      us to investigate the use of established drugs, licensed for other therapeutic 
      indications, for their potential application in cognitive disorders. This 
      strategy, referred to as "drug repositioning," has been successful in many other 
      areas including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. To our knowledge, this is the 
      first study to investigate the effects of long-term treatment with verapamil, a 
      calcium channel blocker commonly prescribed for various cardiovascular conditions 
      and recently applied for prevention of cluster headaches, on the development of 
      cognitive impairment in aged animals. Verapamil was studied at a low dose 
      (1mg/kg/d) in a mouse model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Oral treatment 
      with verapamil or vehicle was started, 24 h post-intracerebroventricular (ICV) 
      streptozotocin/(STZ), in 12-month-old animals and continued for 3 months. 
      Cognitive function was assessed using established tests for spatial learning, 
      short-term/working memory, and long-term/reference memory. Our findings 
      demonstrate that long-term low-dose verapamil effectively prevents development of 
      ICV/STZ-induced cognitive impairment. It mitigates the astrogliosis and synaptic 
      toxicity otherwise induced by ICV/STZ in the hippocampus of aged animals. These 
      findings indicate that long-term, low-dose verapamil may delay progression of sAD 
      in susceptible subjects of advanced age.

TI  - Model Amphipathic Peptide Coupled with Tacrine to Improve Its Antiproliferative 
      Activity.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22010242 [doi]
LID - 242
AB  - Drug repurposing and drug combination are two strategies that have been widely 
      used to overcome the traditional development of new anticancer drugs. Several 
      FDA-approved drugs for other indications have been tested and have demonstrated 
      beneficial anticancer effects. In this connection, our research group recently 
      reported that Tacrine, used to treat Alzheimer's Disease, inhibits the growth of 
      breast cancer MCF-7 cells both alone and in combination with a reference drug. In 
      this view, we have now coupled Tacrine with the model amphipathic 
      cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) MAP, to ascertain whether coupling of the CPP 
      might enhance the drug's antiproliferative properties. To this end, we 
      synthesized MAP through solid-phase peptide synthesis, coupled it with Tacrine, 
      and made a comparative evaluation of the parent drug, peptide, and the conjugate 
      regarding their permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), ability to 
      inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in vitro, and antiproliferative activity on 
      cancer cells. Both MAP and its Tacrine conjugate were highly toxic to MCF-7 and 
      SH-SY5Y cells. In turn, BBB-permeability studies were inconclusive, and 
      conjugation to the CPP led to a considerable loss of Tacrine function as an AChE 
      inhibitor. Nonetheless, this work reinforces the potential of repurposing Tacrine 
      for cancer and enhances the antiproliferative activity of this drug through its 
      conjugation to a CPP.

      Infections.

AB  - Kinases are a group of therapeutic targets involved in the progression of 
      numerous diseases, including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, 
      and viral infections. The majority of approved antiviral agents are inhibitors of 
      virus-specific targets that are encoded by individual viruses. These inhibitors 
      are narrow-spectrum agents that can cause resistance development. Viruses are 
      dependent on host cellular proteins, including kinases, for progression of their 
      life-cycle. Thus, targeting kinases is an important therapeutic approach to 
      discovering broad-spectrum antiviral agents. As there are a large number of FDA 
      approved kinase inhibitors for various indications, their repurposing for viral 
      infections is an attractive and time-sparing strategy. Many kinase inhibitors, 
      including baricitinib, ruxolitinib, imatinib, tofacitinib, pacritinib, 
      zanubrutinib, and ibrutinib, are under clinical investigation for COVID-19. 
      Herein, we discuss FDA approved kinase inhibitors, along with a repertoire of 
      clinical/preclinical stage kinase inhibitors that possess antiviral activity or 
      are useful in the management of viral infections.

AB  - β-Amyloid oligomers (AβOs) and neuroinflammation are 2 main culprits to 
      counteract in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Doxycycline (DOXY) is a second generation 
      antibiotic of the tetracycline class that are promising drugs tested in many 
      clinical trials for a number of different pathologies. DOXY is endowed with 
      antiamyloidogenic properties and better crosses the blood-brain barrier, but its 
      efficacy has never been tested in AD mice. We herein show that 15- to 
      16-month-old APP/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) AD mice receiving DOXY under different 
      treatment regimens recovered their memory without plaque reduction. An acute DOXY 
      treatment was, also, sufficient to improve APP/PS1 mouse memory, suggesting an 
      action against soluble AβOs. This was confirmed in an AβO-induced mouse model, 
      where the AβO-mediated memory impairment was abolished by a DOXY pretreatment. 
      Although AβOs induce memory impairment through glial activation, assessing the 
      anti-inflammatory action of DOXY, we found that in both the AβO-treated and 
      APP/PS1 mice, the memory recovery was associated with a lower neuroinflammation. 
      Our data promote DOXY as a hopeful repositioned drug counteracting crucial 
      neuropathological AD targets.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Donepezil is a front-line treatment for Alzheimer's disease. 
      Donepezil treatment is associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality. 
      Specific protection is observed in pneumonia and cardiovascular disease. We 
      hypothesized that donepezil treatment would improve mortality among Alzheimer's 
      patients following infection with COVID-19. The objective of this study is to 
      assess the influence of ongoing donepezil treatment on survival in Alzheimer's 
      disease patients after polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 
      infection. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. We conducted a national 
      survey of Veterans with Alzheimer's disease to assess the influence of ongoing 
      donepezil treatment on survival in Alzheimer's disease patients after 
      PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection. We assessed all-cause 30-day mortality 
      stratified by COVID-19 infection and donepezil use, estimating odds ratios using 
      multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among people with Alzheimer's disease 
      and COVID-19, all-cause 30-day mortality was 29% (47/163) for people taking 
      donepezil compared with 38% (159/419) for those who were not. Among people with 
      Alzheimer's disease without COVID-19, all-cause 30-day mortality was 5% 
      (189/4189) for people taking donepezil compared with 7% (712/10,241) for those 
      who were not. Adjusting for covariates, the decrease in mortality associated with 
      donepezil did not differ between people with and without COVID-19 (interaction 
      p = 0.710). CONCLUSION: The known survival benefits of donepezil were retained 
      but not found to be specific to COVID-19 among people with Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common 
      cause of dementia. Programmed cell death (PCD) is mainly characterized by unique 
      morphological features and energy-dependent biochemical processes. The 
      predominant pathway leading to cell death in AD has not been thoroughly analyzed, 
      although there is evidence of neuron loss in AD and numerous pathways of PCD have 
      been associated with this process. A better understanding of the systems biology 
      underlying the relationship between AD and PCD could lead to the development of 
      new therapeutic approaches. To this end, publicly available transcriptome data 
      were examined using bioinformatic methods such as differential gene expression 
      and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to find PCD-related AD 
      biomarkers. The diagnostic significance of these biomarkers was evaluated using a 
      logistic regression-based predictive model. Using these biomarkers, a 
      multifactorial regulatory network was developed. Last, a drug repositioning study 
      was conducted to propose new drugs for the treatment of AD targeting PCD. The 
      development of 3PM (predictive, preventive, and personalized) drugs for the 
      treatment of AD would be enabled by additional research on the effects of these 
      drugs on this disease.

LID - 10.1101/2024.06.04.595773 [doi]
AB  - Neuroinflammation is a pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, 
      including Alzheimer's disease (AD)(1,2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS)(3), raising the possibility of common therapeutic targets. We previously 
      established that cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (cdsRNA) is spatially coincident 
      with cytoplasmic pTDP-43 inclusions in neurons of patients with C9ORF72-mediated 
      ALS(4). CdsRNA triggers a type-I interferon (IFN-I)-based innate immune response 
      in human neural cells, resulting in their death(4). Here, we report that cdsRNA 
      is also spatially coincident with pTDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions in brain cells 
      of patients with AD pathology and that type-I interferon response genes are 
      significantly upregulated in brain regions affected by AD. We updated our 
      machine-learning pipeline DRIAD-SP (Drug Repurposing In Alzheimer's Disease with 
      Systems Pharmacology) to incorporate cryptic exon (CE) detection as a proxy of 
      pTDP-43 inclusions and demonstrated that the FDA-approved JAK inhibitors 
      baricitinib and ruxolitinib that block interferon signaling show a protective 
      signal only in cortical brain regions expressing multiple CEs. Furthermore, the 
      JAK family member TYK2 was a top hit in a CRISPR screen of cdsRNA-mediated death 
      in differentiated human neural cells. The selective TYK2 inhibitor 
      deucravacitinib, an FDA-approved drug for psoriasis, rescued toxicity elicited by 
      cdsRNA. Finally, we identified CCL2, CXCL10, and IL-6 as candidate predictive 
      biomarkers for cdsRNA-related neurodegenerative diseases. Together, we find 
      parallel neuroinflammatory mechanisms between TDP-43 associated-AD and ALS and 
      nominate TYK2 as a possible disease-modifying target of these incurable 
      neurodegenerative diseases.

LID - 10.3233/JAD-190305 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Teprenone (geranylgeranylacetone), an anti-ulcer agent, has been 
      reported to inhibit amyloid-β increase, senile plaque formation, and neuronal 
      degeneration, and improve memory in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
      ascertain teprenone's therapeutic ability for AD. METHODS: Patients with mild to 
      moderate AD, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 13 to 26, were 
      randomly allocated into two groups depending on the administered drug: 
      donepezil +  placebo (placebo group) and donepezil + teprenone (teprenone group). 
      The primary and secondary endpoints included changes in scores of the Japanese 
      version of the AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-J cog) and other 
      evaluations, respectively, including MMSE scores, during a 12-month period after 
      the first administration. RESULTS: Forty-two and thirty-seven patients were 
      allocated to the teprenone and placebo groups, respectively. ADAS-J cog score 
      changes were not different between groups (placebo, 0.6±0.8; teprenone, 0.4±0.8; 
      p = 0.861). However, MMSE scores significantly improved in the teprenone group 
      (placebo, - 1.2±0.5; teprenone, 0.2±0.5; p = 0.044). Subgroup analysis 
      considering the severity of medial temporal area atrophy revealed that this 
      improvement by teprenone was significant in patients with mild (p = 0.013) but 
      not with severe atrophy (p = 0.611). Adverse events were observed in 17.8 and 
      10.4% of patients in the placebo and teprenone group, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Teprenone may be effective for AD when administered before atrophy progression in 
      the medial temporal areas. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN ID: UMIN000016843.

AB  - The multifactorial neurological condition called Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      primarily affects elderly individuals. Despite the calamitous consequences of AD, 
      curative strategies for a regimen to apply remain inadequate as several factors 
      contribute to AD etiology. Drug repurposing is an advance strategy prior to drug 
      discovery as various effective drugs perform through alteration of multiple 
      targets, and the present "poly-pharmacology" can be a curative approach to 
      complex disorders. AD's multifactorial behavior actively encourages the 
      hypothesis for a drug design approach focused on drug repurposing. In this study, 
      we discovered that an antifungal drug, Caspofungin (CAS) is a potent Aβ 
      aggregation inhibitor that displays significantly reduced toxicity associated 
      with AD. Drug reprofiling and REMD simulations demonstrated that CAS interacts 
      with the β-sheet section, known as Aβ amyloid fibrils hotspot. CAS leads to 
      destabilization of β-sheet and, conclusively, in its devaluation. Later, in vitro 
      experiments were acquired in which the fibrillar volume was reduced for 
      CAS-treated Aβ peptide. For the first time ever, this study has determined an 
      antifungal agent as the Aβ amyloid aggregation's potent inhibitor. Several 
      efficient sequence-reliant potent inhibitors can be developed in future against 
      the amyloid aggregation for different amyloid peptide by the processing and 
      conformational optimization of CAS.

LID - 14
AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex disease and the leading cause of dementia 
      in older people. We aimed to uncover aspects of AD's pathogenesis that may 
      contribute to drug repurposing efforts by integrating DNA methylation and genetic 
      data. Implementing the network-based tool, a dense module search of genome-wide 
      association studies (dmGWAS), we integrated a large-scale GWAS dataset with DNA 
      methylation data to identify gene network modules associated with AD. Our 
      analysis yielded 286 significant gene network modules. Notably, the foremost 
      module included the BIN1 gene, showing the largest GWAS signal, and the GNAS 
      gene, the most significantly hypermethylated. We conducted Web-based 
      Cell-type-Specific Enrichment Analysis (WebCSEA) on genes within the top 10% of 
      dmGWAS modules, highlighting monocyte as the most significant cell type (p < 5 × 
      10(-12)). Functional enrichment analysis revealed Gene Ontology Biological 
      Process terms relevant to AD pathology (adjusted p < 0.05). Additionally, drug 
      target enrichment identified five FDA-approved targets (p-value = 0.03) for 
      further research. In summary, dmGWAS integration of genetic and epigenetic 
      signals unveiled new gene interactions related to AD, offering promising avenues 
      for future studies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current treatments for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative 
      diseases have only limited effectiveness meaning that there is an urgent need for 
      new medications that could influence disease incidence and progression. We will 
      investigate the potential of a selection of commonly prescribed drugs, as a more 
      efficient and cost-effective method of identifying new drugs for the prevention 
      or treatment of Alzheimer's disease, non-Alzheimer's disease dementias, 
      Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our research will focus on 
      drugs used for the treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and type 2 
      diabetes, all of which have previously been identified as potentially 
      cerebroprotective and have variable levels of preclinical evidence that suggest 
      they may have beneficial effects for various aspects of dementia pathology. 
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a hypothesis testing observational cohort 
      study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Our 
      analysis will consider four statistical methods, which have different approaches 
      for modelling confounding. These are multivariable adjusted Cox regression; 
      propensity matched regression; instrumental variable analysis and marginal 
      structural models. We will also use an intention-to-treat analysis, whereby we 
      will define all exposures based on the first prescription observed in the 
      database so that the target parameter is comparable to that estimated by a 
      randomised controlled trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been 
      approved by the CPRD's Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC). We will 
      publish the results of the study as open-access peer-reviewed publications and 
      disseminate findings through national and international conferences as are 
      appropriate.

TI  - A Prospective Repurposing of Dantrolene as a Multitarget Agent for Alzheimer's 
      Disease.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24234298 [doi]
LID - 4298
AB  - The orphan drug dantrolene (DAN) is the only therapeutic treatment for malignant 
      hyperthermia (MH), a pharmacogenetic pathology affecting 0.2 over 10,000 people 
      in the EU. It acts by inhibiting ryanodine receptors, which are responsible for 
      calcium recruitment in striatal muscles and brain. Because of its involvement in 
      calcium homeostasis, DAN has been successfully investigated for its potential as 
      neuroprotecting small molecule in several animal models of Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). Nevertheless, its effects at a molecular level, namely on putative targets 
      involved in neurodegeneration, are still scarcely known. Herein, we present a 
      prospective study on repurposing of DAN involving, besides the well-known calcium 
      antagonism, inhibition of monoamine oxidase B and acetylcholinesterase, 
      cytoprotection from oxidative insult, and activation of carnitine/acylcarnitine 
      carrier, as concurring biological activities responsible for neuroprotection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease, a lethal neurodegenerative disorder that leads 
      to progressive memory loss, is the most common form of dementia. Owing to the 
      complexity of the disease, its root cause still remains unclear. The existing 
      anti-Alzheimer's drugs are unable to cure the disease while the current 
      therapeutic options have provided only limited help in restoring moderate memory 
      and remain ineffective at restricting the disease's progression. The 
      striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) has been shown to be 
      involved in the internalization of the receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDR) and 
      thus is associated with the disease. The present study was performed using 
      machine learning algorithms, docking protocol and molecular dynamics (MD) 
      simulations to develop STEP inhibitors, which could be novel anti-Alzheimer's 
      molecules. METHODS: The present study deals with the generation of computational 
      predictive models based on chemical descriptors of compounds using machine 
      learning approaches followed by substructure fragment analysis. To perform this 
      analysis, the 2D molecular descriptors were generated and machine learning 
      algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Sequential Minimization Optimization) 
      were utilized. The binding mechanisms and the molecular interactions between the 
      predicted active compounds and the target protein were modelled using docking 
      methods. Further, the stability of the protein-ligand complex was evaluated using 
      MD simulation studies. The substructure fragment analysis was performed using 
      Substructure fingerprint (SubFp), which was further explored using a predefined 
      dictionary. RESULTS: The present study demonstrates that the computational 
      methodology used can be employed to examine the biological activities of small 
      molecules and prioritize them for experimental screening. Large unscreened 
      chemical libraries can be screened to identify potential novel hits and 
      accelerate the drug discovery process. Additionally, the chemical libraries can 
      be searched for significant substructure patterns as reported in the present 
      study, thus possibly contributing to the activity of these molecules.

AB  - The efficacy of current treatments is still insufficient for Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD), the most common cause of Dementia. Out of the two pathological hallmarks of 
      AD amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, comprising of tau protein, tau 
      pathology strongly correlates with the symptoms of AD. Previously, screening for 
      inhibitors of tau aggregation that target recombinant tau aggregates have been 
      attempted. Since a recent cryo-EM analysis revealed distinct differences in the 
      folding patterns of heparin-induced recombinant tau filaments and AD tau 
      filaments, this study focused on AD seed-dependent tau aggregation in drug 
      repositioning for AD. We screened 763 compounds from an FDA-approved drug library 
      using an AD seed-induced tau aggregation in SH-SY5Y cell-based assay. In the 
      first screening, 180 compounds were selected, 72 of which were excluded based on 
      the results of lactate dehydrogenase assay. In the third screening with 
      evaluations of soluble and insoluble tau, 38 compounds were selected. In the 
      fourth screening with 3 different AD seeds, 4 compounds, lansoprazole, 
      calcipotriene, desogestrel, and pentamidine isethionate, were selected. After AD 
      seed-induced real-time quaking-induced conversion, lansoprazole was selected as 
      the most suitable drug for repositioning. The intranasal administration of 
      lansoprazole for 4 months to AD seed-injected mice improved locomotor activity 
      and reduced both the amount of insoluble tau and the extent of phosphorylated 
      tau-positive areas. Alanine replacement of the predicted binding site to an AD 
      filament indicated the involvement of Q351, H362, and K369 in lansoprazole and 
      C-shaped tau filaments. These results suggest the potential of lansoprazole as a 
      candidate for drug repositioning to an inhibitor of tau aggregate formation in 
      AD.

TI  - ABC Transporter C1 Prevents Dimethyl Fumarate from Targeting Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 10.3390/biology12070932 [doi]
LID - 932
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, is a growing health 
      issue with very limited treatment options. To meet the need for novel 
      therapeutics, existing drugs with additional preferred pharmacological profiles 
      could be recruited. This strategy is known as 'drug repurposing'. Here, we 
      describe dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a drug approved to treat multiple sclerosis 
      (MS), to be tested as a candidate for other brain diseases. We used an 
      APP-transgenic model (APPtg) of senile β-amyloidosis mice to further investigate 
      the potential of DMF as a novel AD therapeutic. We treated male and female APPtg 
      mice through drinking water at late stages of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition. We found 
      that DMF treatment did not result in modulating effects on Aβ deposition at this 
      stage. Interestingly, we found that glutathione-modified DMF interacts with the 
      ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCC1, an important gatekeeper at the 
      blood-brain and blood-plexus barriers and a key player for Aβ export from the 
      brain. Our findings suggest that ABCC1 prevents the effects of DMF, which makes 
      DMF unsuitable as a novel therapeutic drug against AD. The discovered effects of 
      ABCC1 also have implications for DMF treatment of multiple sclerosis.

AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogenic bacterium involved in the 
      pathogenesis of periodontitis. Citrullination has been reported as the underlying 
      mechanism of the pathogenesis, which relies on the interplay between two 
      virulence factors of the bacterium, namely gingipain R and the bacterial peptidyl 
      arginine deiminase. Gingipain R cleaves host proteins to expose the C-terminal 
      arginines for peptidyl arginine deiminase to citrullinate and generate 
      citrullinated proteins. Apart from carrying out citrullination in the 
      periodontium, the bacterium is found capable of citrullinating proteins present 
      in the host synovial tissues, atherosclerotic plaques and neurons. Studies have 
      suggested that both virulence factors are the key factors that trigger distal 
      effects mediated by citrullination, leading to the development of some 
      non-communicable diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and 
      Alzheimer's disease. Thus, inhibition of these virulence factors not only can 
      mitigate periodontitis, but also can provide new therapeutic solutions for 
      systematic diseases involving bacterial citrullination. Herein, we described both 
      these proteins in terms of their unique structural conformations and biological 
      relevance to different human diseases. Moreover, investigations of inhibitory 
      actions on the enzymes are also enumerated. New approaches for identifying 
      inhibitors for peptidyl arginine deiminase through drug repurposing and virtual 
      screening are also discussed.

TI  - Elucidating the Interactions of Fluoxetine with Human Transferrin Employing 
      Spectroscopic, Calorimetric, and In Silico Approaches: Implications of a Potent 
      Alzheimer's Drug.
PG  - 9015-9023
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c00182 [doi]
AB  - Neurodegenerative complexities, such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
      so forth, have been a crucial health concern for ages. Transferrin (Tf) is a 
      chief target to explore in AD management. Fluoxetine (FXT) presents itself as a 
      potent anti-AD drug-like compound and has been explored against several diseases 
      based on the drug repurposing readings. The present study delineates the binding 
      of FXT to Tf employing structure-based docking, molecular dynamics (MD) 
      simulations, and principal component analysis (PCA). Docking results showed the 
      binding of FXT with Tf with an appreciable binding affinity, making various close 
      interactions. MD simulation of FXT with Tf for 100 ns suggested their stable 
      binding without any significant structural alteration. Furthermore, 
      fluorescence-based binding revealed a significant interaction between FXT and Tf. 
      FXT binds to Tf with a binding constant of 5.5 × 10(5) M(-1). Isothermal 
      titration calorimetry (ITC) advocated the binding of FXT to Tf as spontaneous in 
      nature, affirming earlier observations. This work indicated plausible 
      interactions between FXT and Tf, which are worth considering for further studies 
      in the clinical management of neurological disorders, including AD.

AB  - Known γ-secretase inhibitors or modulators display an undesirable pharmacokinetic 
      profile and toxicity and have therefore not been successful in clinical trials 
      for Alzheimer's disease (AD). So far, no compounds from natural products have 
      been identified as direct inhibitors of γ-secretase. To search for bioactive 
      molecules that can reduce the amount of amyloid-beta peptides (Aβ) and that have 
      better pharmacokinetics and an improved safety profile, we completed a screen of 
      ~400 natural products by using cell-based and cell-free γ-secretase activity 
      assays. We identified dihydroergocristine (DHEC), a component of an FDA- (Food 
      and Drug Administration)-approved drug, to be a direct inhibitor of γ-secretase. 
      Micromolar concentrations of DHEC substantially reduced Aβ levels in different 
      cell types, including a cell line derived from an AD patient. Structure-activity 
      relationship studies implied that the key moiety for inhibiting γ-secretase is 
      the cyclized tripeptide moiety of DHEC. A Surface Plasmon Resonance assay showed 
      that DHEC binds directly to γ-secretase and Nicastrin, with equilibrium 
      dissociation constants (Kd) of 25.7 nM and 9.8 μM, respectively. This study 
      offers DHEC not only as a new chemical moiety for selectively modulating the 
      activity of γ-secretase but also a candidate for drug repositioning in 
      Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Activation of a cytoprotective cellular pathway known as the heat shock response 
      (HSR) is a promising strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) is a commonly used 
      anti-ulcer drug in Japan that has been shown to activate the HSR. Here, we 
      establish C. elegans as a model system to investigate the effects of GGA. First, 
      we show that GGA-mediated activation of the HSR is conserved in worms. Then, we 
      show that GGA can ameliorate beta-amyloid toxicity in both muscle and neuronal 
      worm Alzheimer's disease models. Finally, we find that exposure to GGA is 
      sufficient to extend the lifespan of wild-type worms. Significantly, the 
      beneficial effects of GGA on both beta-amyloid toxicity and lifespan are 
      dependent on HSR activation. Taken together, this research supports further 
      development of GGA as a therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease, provides evidence 
      that HSR activation is a relevant therapeutic mechanism, and indicates that the 
      beneficial effects of GGA are not limited to disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-70% of dementia cases. Current treatments are 
      inadequate and there is a need to develop new approaches to drug discovery. 
      Recently, in cancer, morphological profiling has been used in combination with 
      high-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries in human cells in vitro. To 
      test feasibility of this approach for Alzheimer's disease, we developed a cell 
      morphology-based drug screen centred on the risk gene, SORL1 (which encodes the 
      protein SORLA). Increased Alzheimer's disease risk has been repeatedly linked to 
      variants in SORL1, particularly those conferring loss or decreased expression of 
      SORLA, and lower SORL1 levels are observed in post-mortem brain samples from 
      individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Consistent with its role in the 
      endolysosomal pathway, SORL1 deletion is associated with enlarged endosomes in 
      neural progenitor cells and neurons. We, therefore, hypothesized that 
      multi-parametric, image-based cell phenotyping would identify features 
      characteristic of SORL1 deletion. An automated morphological profiling method 
      (Cell Painting) was adapted to neural progenitor cells and used to determine the 
      phenotypic response of SORL1(-/-) neural progenitor cells to treatment with 
      compounds from a small internationally approved drug library (TargetMol, 330 
      compounds). We detected distinct phenotypic signatures for SORL1(-/-) neural 
      progenitor cells compared to isogenic wild-type controls. Furthermore, we 
      identified 16 compounds (representing 14 drugs) that reversed the mutant 
      morphological signatures in neural progenitor cells derived from three SORL1(-/-) 
      induced pluripotent stem cell sub-clones. Network pharmacology analysis revealed 
      the 16 compounds belonged to five mechanistic groups: 20S proteasome, aldehyde 
      dehydrogenase, topoisomerase I and II, and DNA synthesis inhibitors. Enrichment 
      analysis identified DNA synthesis/damage/repair, proteases/proteasome and 
      metabolism as key pathways/biological processes. Prediction of novel targets 
      revealed enrichment in pathways associated with neural cell function and 
      Alzheimer's disease. Overall, this work suggests that (i) a quantitative 
      phenotypic metric can distinguish induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 
      SORL1(-/-) neural progenitor cells from isogenic wild-type controls and (ii) 
      phenotypic screening combined with multi-parametric high-content image analysis 
      is a viable option for drug repurposing and discovery in this human neural cell 
      model of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The targeting of disease-related proteins is important for drug 
      discovery, and yet target-based discovery has not been fruitful. Contextualizing 
      overall biological processes is critical to formulating successful drug-disease 
      hypotheses. Network pharmacology helps to overcome target-based bottlenecks 
      through systems biology analytics, such as protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
      networks and pathway regulation. RESULTS: We present a systems polypharmacology 
      platform entitled DrugGenEx-Net (DGE-NET). DGE-NET predicts empirical drug-target 
      (DT) interactions, integrates interaction pairs into a multi-tiered network 
      analysis, and ultimately predicts disease-specific drug polypharmacology through 
      systems-based gene expression analysis. Incorporation of established biological 
      network annotations for protein target-disease, -signaling pathway, -molecular 
      function, and protein-protein interactions enhances predicted DT effects on 
      disease pathophysiology. Over 50 drug-disease and 100 drug-pathway predictions 
      are validated. For example, the predicted systems pharmacology of the 
      cholesterol-lowering agent ezetimibe corroborates its potential carcinogenicity. 
      When disease-specific gene expression analysis is integrated, DGE-NET prioritizes 
      known therapeutics/experimental drugs as well as their contra-indications. 
      Proof-of-concept is established for immune-related rheumatoid arthritis and 
      inflammatory bowel disease, as well as neuro-degenerative Alzheimer's and 
      Parkinson's diseases. CONCLUSIONS: DGE-NET is a novel computational method that 
      predicting drug therapeutic and counter-therapeutic indications by uniquely 
      integrating systems pharmacology with gene expression analysis. DGE-NET correctly 
      predicts various drug-disease indications by linking the biological activity of 
      drugs and diseases at multiple tiers of biological action, and is therefore a 
      useful approach to identifying drug candidates for re-purposing.

AB  - Deregulated cancer cell metabolism plays an important role in cancer progression. 
      Cancer cell metabolism has been in the centre of attention in therapeutical 
      cancer cell targeting. Repurposed chemical agents, such as metformin and aspirin, 
      have been studied extensively as preventive and therapeutic agents. Metformin is 
      Food and Drug administration (FDA)-approved antidiabetic drug cheaper than other 
      chemotherapeutic agents that were shown to have anticancer effects. Memantine is 
      an FDA-approved Alzheimer's drug. Drug repositioning studies offer wide range of 
      benefits, such as reduced time, cost and risk over de novo drug discovery. 
      Therefore, we aimed to target glucose and glutamine metabolism in 
      androgen-dependent LNCaP cells by using metformin and memantine and investigate 
      these agents' effects on prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro. We 
      evaluated the effects of metformin and memantine on the protein expression levels 
      of genes that play significant roles in apoptosis and cell cycle progression 
      (Casp3, Casp9, Bcl-2, Survivin, Bax, c-Myc, HIF1A, CCND1, CDK4 and GAPDH) by 
      Western blotting. Alzheimer's drug memantine exerted cytotoxic effects at 0.25 mM 
      and metformin at 2.5 mM. We identified for the first time that memantine exerts 
      antineoplastic activity (0.25 mM) by triggering Bax-dependent pathway of 
      apoptosis. In addition to that both molecules have shown similar patterns on pro- 
      and anti-apoptotic protein expression levels, such as Bcl-2, Casp3, Survivin and 
      Bax. Our preclinic results indicate that memantine might be used as a new 
      repositioned drug in cancer treatment. Beyond targeting glucose metabolism, 
      glutamine metabolism also holds great promise for a potential treatment option.

AB  - The high number of failed pre-clinical and clinical studies for compounds 
      targeting Alzheimer disease (AD) has demonstrated that there is a need to 
      reassess existing strategies. Here, we pursue a holistic, mechanism-centric drug 
      repurposing approach combining computational analytics and experimental screening 
      data. Based on this integrative workflow, we identified 77 druggable modifiers of 
      tau phosphorylation (pTau). One of the upstream modulators of pTau, HDAC6, was 
      screened with 5,632 drugs in a tau-specific assay, resulting in the 
      identification of 20 repurposing candidates. Four compounds and their known 
      targets were found to have a link to AD-specific genes. Our approach can be 
      applied to a variety of AD-associated pathophysiological mechanisms to identify 
      more repurposing candidates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests patients prescribed calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) 
      have a reduced prevalence of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD); 
      however, this result has never been replicated in a large cohort and the involved 
      mechanism(s) and site of action (central versus periphery) remain unclear. 
      OBJECTIVE: We aim to determine if prescription of CNIs is associated with reduced 
      prevalence of dementia, including AD, in a large, diverse patient population. 
      Furthermore, we aim to gain insight into the mechanism(s) and site of action for 
      CNIs to reduce dementia prevalence. METHODS: Electronic health records (EHRs) 
      from patients prescribed tacrolimus, cyclosporine, or sirolimus were analyzed to 
      compare prevalence, odds, and hazard ratios related to dementia diagnoses among 
      cohorts. EHRs from a random, heterogeneous population from the same network were 
      obtained to generate a general population-like control. RESULTS: All drugs 
      examined reduced dementia prevalence compared to the general population-like 
      control. There were no differences in dementia diagnoses upon comparing 
      tacrolimus and sirolimus; however, patients prescribed tacrolimus had a reduced 
      dementia prevalence relative to cyclosporine. CONCLUSION: Converging mechanisms 
      of action between tacrolimus and sirolimus likely explain the similar dementia 
      prevalence between the cohorts. Calcineurin inhibition within the brain has a 
      greater probability of reducing dementia relative to peripherally-restricted 
      calcineurin inhibition. Overall, immunosuppressants provide a promising 
      therapeutic avenue for dementia, with emphasis on the brain-penetrant CNI 
      tacrolimus.

TI  - Navigating the Gene Co-Expression Network and Drug Repurposing Opportunities for 
      Brain Disorders Associated with Neurocognitive Impairment.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci13111564 [doi]
LID - 1564
AB  - Neurocognitive impairment refers to a spectrum of disorders characterized by a 
      decline in cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and problem-solving, 
      which are often linked to structural or functional abnormalities in the brain. 
      While its exact etiology remains elusive, genetic factors play a pivotal role in 
      disease onset and progression. This study aimed to identify highly correlated 
      gene clusters (modules) and key hub genes shared across neurocognition-impairing 
      diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease with dementia 
      (PDD), HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), and glioma. Herein, the 
      microarray datasets AD (GSE5281), HAND (GSE35864), glioma (GSE15824), and PD 
      (GSE7621) were used to perform Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis 
      (WGCNA) to identify highly preserved modules across the studied brain diseases. 
      Through gene set enrichment analysis, the shared modules were found to point 
      towards processes including neuronal transcriptional dysregulation, 
      neuroinflammation, protein aggregation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, hallmarks 
      of many neurocognitive disorders. These modules were used in constructing 
      protein-protein interaction networks to identify hub genes shared across the 
      diseases of interest. These hub genes were found to play pivotal roles in 
      processes including protein homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, energy 
      metabolism, and signaling, all associated with brain and CNS diseases, and were 
      explored for their drug repurposing experiments. Drug repurposing based on gene 
      signatures highlighted drugs including Dorzolamide and Oxybuprocaine, which were 
      found to modulate the expression of the hub genes in play and may have 
      therapeutic implications in neurocognitive disorders. While both drugs have 
      traditionally been used for other medical purposes, our study underscores the 
      potential of a combined WGCNA and drug repurposing strategy for searching for new 
      avenues in the simultaneous treatment of different diseases that have 
      similarities in gene co-expression networks.

TI  - Inferring new indications for approved drugs via random walk on drug-disease 
      heterogenous networks.
PG  - 539

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since traditional drug research and development is often 
      time-consuming and high-risk, there is an increasing interest in establishing new 
      medical indications for approved drugs, referred to as drug repositioning, which 
      provides a relatively low-cost and high-efficiency approach for drug discovery. 
      With the explosive growth of large-scale biochemical and phenotypic data, drug 
      repositioning holds great potential for precision medicine in the post-genomic 
      era. It is urgent to develop rational and systematic approaches to predict new 
      indications for approved drugs on a large scale. RESULTS: In this paper, we 
      propose the two-pass random walks with restart on a heterogenous network, 
      TP-NRWRH for short, to predict new indications for approved drugs. Rather than 
      random walk on bipartite network, we integrated the drug-drug similarity network, 
      disease-disease similarity network and known drug-disease association network 
      into one heterogenous network, on which the two-pass random walks with restart is 
      implemented. We have conducted performance evaluation on two datasets of 
      drug-disease associations, and the results show that our method has higher 
      performance than six existing methods. A case study on the Alzheimer's disease 
      showed that nine of top 10 predicted drugs have been approved or investigational 
      for neurodegenerative diseases. The experimental results show that our method 
      achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting new indications for approved 
      drugs. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a two-pass random walk with restart on the 
      drug-disease heterogeneous network, referred to as TP-NRWRH, to predict new 
      indications for approved drugs. Performance evaluation on two independent 
      datasets showed that TP-NRWRH achieved higher performance than six existing 
      methods on 10-fold cross validations. The case study on the Alzheimer's disease 
      showed that nine of top 10 predicted drugs have been approved or are 
      investigational for neurodegenerative diseases. The results show that our method 
      achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting new indications for approved 
      drugs.

TI  - Antitumor effect of memantine is related to the formation of the splicing isoform 
      of GLG1, a decoy FGF‑binding protein.
LID - 80 [pii]
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2022.5370 [doi]
AB  - Drug repositioning is a strategy for repurposing the approved or investigational 
      drugs that are outside the scope of the original medical indication. Memantine is 
      used as a non‑competitive N‑methyl‑D‑aspartate receptor antagonist to prevent 
      glutamate‑mediated excitotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease, and is one of the 
      promising agents which is utilized for the purpose of cancer therapy. However, 
      the association between memantine and Golgi glycoprotein 1 (GLG1), an 
      intracellular fibroblast growth factor receptor, in cancers has not yet been 
      clarified. The present study analyzed the expression and location of GLG1 in 
      tumor cells treated with memantine. Memantine was found to suppress the growth of 
      malignant glioma and breast cancer cells in a concentration‑dependent manner. The 
      mRNA expression of GLG1 was upregulated in a concentration‑dependent manner, and 
      the splicing variant profiles were altered in all cell lines examined. The 
      results of western blot analysis revealed an increase in the full‑length and 
      truncated forms of GLG1. Moreover, GLG1 spread in the cytosol of 
      memantine‑treated cells, whereas it localized in the Golgi apparatus in control 
      cells. Since GLG1 functions as a decoy FGF receptor, the modulation of GLG1 may 
      prove to be one of the mechanisms underlying the cancer‑suppressive effects of 
      memantine.

TI  - Repurposing FDA-Approved Compounds for the Discovery of Glutaminyl Cyclase 
      Inhibitors as Drugs Against Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 877-881
LID - 10.1002/open.202000235 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative causes of 
      dementia, the pathology of which is still not much clear. It's challenging to 
      discover the disease modifying agents for the prevention and treatment of AD over 
      the years. Emerging evidence has been accumulated to reveal the crucial role of 
      up-regulated glutaminyl cyclase (QC) in the initiation of AD. In the current 
      study, the QC inhibitory potency of a library consisting of 1621 FDA-approved 
      compounds was assessed. A total of 54 hits, 3.33 % of the pool, exhibited QC 
      inhibitory activities. The Ki of the top 5 compounds with the highest QC 
      inhibitory activities were measured. Among these selected hits, compounds 
      affecting neuronal signaling pathways and other mechanisms were recognized. 
      Moreover, several polyphenol derivatives with QC inhibitory activities were also 
      identified. Frameworks and subsets contained in these hits were analyzed. Taken 
      together, our results may contribute to the discovery and development of novel QC 
      inhibitors as potential anti-AD agents.

TI  - Repurposing of phyto-ligand molecules from the honey bee products for Alzheimer's 
      disease as novel inhibitors of BACE-1: small molecule bioinformatics strategies 
      as amyloid-based therapy.
PG  - 51143-51169

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases, manifesting 
      dementia, spatial disorientation, language, cognitive, and functional impairment, 
      mainly affects the elderly population with a growing concern about the financial 
      burden on society. Repurposing can improve the traditional progress of drug 
      design applications and could speed up the identification of innovative remedies 
      for AD. The pursuit of potent anti-BACE-1 drugs for AD treatment has become a pot 
      boiler topic in the recent past and to instigate the design of novel improved 
      inhibitors from the bee products. Drug-likeness characteristics (ADMET: 
      absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), docking (AutoDock 
      Vina), simulation (GROMACS), and free energy interaction (MM-PBSA, molecular 
      mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) analyses were performed to identify the 
      lead candidates from the bee products (500 bioactives from the honey, royal 
      jelly, propolis, bee bread, bee wax, and bee venom) for Alzheimer's disease as 
      novel inhibitors of BACE-1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 
      (1) receptor using appropriate bioinformatics tools. Forty-four bioactive lead 
      compounds were screened from the bee products through high throughput virtual 
      screening on the basis of their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics 
      characteristics, showing favorable intestinal and oral absorption, 
      bioavailability, blood brain barrier penetration, less skin permeability, and no 
      inhibition of cytochrome P450 inhibitors. The docking score of the forty-four 
      ligand molecules was found to be between -4 and -10.3 kcal/mol, respectively, 
      exhibiting strong binding affinity to BACE1 receptor. The highest binding 
      affinity was observed in the rutin (-10.3 kcal/mol), 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid 
      (-9.5 kcal/mol), nemorosone (-9.5 kcal/mol), and luteolin (-8.9 kcal/mol). 
      Furthermore, these compounds demonstrated high total binding energy -73.20 to 
      -105.85 kJ/mol), and low root mean square deviation (0.194-0.202 nm), root mean 
      square fluctuation (0.0985-0.1136 nm), radius of gyration (2.12 nm), number of 
      H-bonds (0.778-5.436), and eigenvector values (2.39-3.54 nm(2)) in the molecular 
      dynamic simulation, signifying restricted motion of Cα atoms, proper folding and 
      flexibility, and highly stable with compact of the BACE1 receptor with the 
      ligands. Docking and simulation studies concluded that rutin, 
      3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid, nemorosone, and luteolin are plausibly used as novel 
      inhibitors of BACE1 to combat AD, but further in-depth experimental 
      investigations are warranted to prove these in silico findings.

TI  - Type I interferon signaling, cognition and neurodegeneration following COVID-19: 
      update on a mechanistic pathogenetic model with implications for Alzheimer's 
      disease.

AB  - COVID-19's effects on the human brain reveal a multifactorial impact on cognition 
      and the potential to inflict lasting neuronal damage. Type I interferon 
      signaling, a pathway that represents our defense against pathogens, is primarily 
      affected by COVID-19. Type I interferon signaling, however, is known to mediate 
      cognitive dysfunction upon its dysregulation following synaptopathy, microgliosis 
      and neuronal damage. In previous studies, we proposed a model of outside-in 
      dysregulation of tonic IFN-I signaling in the brain following a COVID-19. This 
      disruption would be mediated by the crosstalk between central and peripheral 
      immunity, and could potentially establish feed-forward IFN-I dysregulation 
      leading to neuroinflammation and potentially, neurodegeneration. We proposed that 
      for the CNS, the second-order mediators would be intrinsic disease-associated 
      molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as proteopathic seeds, without the requirement of 
      neuroinvasion to sustain inflammation. Selective vulnerability of neurogenesis 
      sites to IFN-I dysregulation would then lead to clinical manifestations such as 
      anosmia and cognitive impairment. Since the inception of our model at the 
      beginning of the pandemic, a growing body of studies has provided further 
      evidence for the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the human CNS and cognition. 
      Several preclinical and clinical studies have displayed IFN-I dysregulation and 
      tauopathy in gene expression and neuropathological data in new cases, 
      correspondingly. Furthermore, neurodegeneration identified with a predilection 
      for the extended olfactory network furthermore supports the neuroanatomical 
      concept of our model, and its independence from fulminant neuroinvasion and 
      encephalitis as a cause of CNS damage. In this perspective, we summarize the data 
      on IFN-I as a plausible mechanism of cognitive impairment in this setting, and 
      its potential contribution to Alzheimer's disease and its interplay with 
      COVID-19.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complicated progressive neurodegeneration disorder. 
      To confront AD, scientists are searching for multi-target-directed ligands 
      (MTDLs) to delay disease progression. The in silico prediction of 
      chemical-protein interactions (CPI) can accelerate target identification and drug 
      discovery. Previously, we developed 100 binary classifiers to predict the CPI for 
      25 key targets against AD using the multi-target quantitative structure-activity 
      relationship (mt-QSAR) method. In this investigation, we aimed to apply the 
      mt-QSAR method to enlarge the model library to predict CPI towards AD. Another 
      104 binary classifiers were further constructed to predict the CPI for 26 
      preclinical AD targets based on the naive Bayesian (NB) and recursive 
      partitioning (RP) algorithms. The internal 5-fold cross-validation and external 
      test set validation were applied to evaluate the performance of the training sets 
      and test set, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
      curve (ROC) for the test sets ranged from 0.629 to 1.0, with an average of 0.903. 
      In addition, we developed a web server named AlzhCPI to integrate the 
      comprehensive information of approximately 204 binary classifiers, which has 
      potential applications in network pharmacology and drug repositioning. AlzhCPI is 
      available online at http://rcidm.org/AlzhCPI/index.html. To illustrate the 
      applicability of AlzhCPI, the developed system was employed for the systems 
      pharmacology-based investigation of shichangpu against AD to enhance the 
      understanding of the mechanisms of action of shichangpu from a holistic 
      perspective.

PG  - 2095-2105

AB  - BACKGROUND: MS is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS leading to 
      demyelination and neurodegeneration, with a complex and still to be clarified 
      aetiology. Several data, coming from patients' samples and from animal models, 
      show that Oxidative Status (OS) plays an important role in MS pathogenesis. 
      Overproduction of reactive oxidative species by macrophages/microglia can bring 
      about cellular injury and ensuing cell death by oxidizing cardinal cellular 
      components. Oxidized molecules are present in active MS lesions and are 
      associated with neurodegeneration. METHODS: We undertook a structured search of 
      bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research literature focusing on OS in 
      MS. The contents of the selected papers were described in the context of a 
      conceptual framework. A special emphasis was given to the results of our study in 
      the field. RESULTS: The results of our three recent studies were put in the 
      context and discussed taking into account the literature on the topic. Oxidative 
      damage underpinned an imbalance shared by MS and neurodegenerative diseases such 
      as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. In people with clinically isolated syndrome 
      (an early phase of MS) oxidative stress proved to contribute to disease 
      pathophysiology and to provide biomarkers that may help predict disease 
      evolution. A drug screening platform based on multiple assays to test the 
      remyelinating potential of library of approved compounds showed two 
      anti-oxidants, edaravone and 5-methyl-7- methoxyisoflavone, as active drugs. 
      Moreover, an analysis of 'structure activity relationship' showed off-targets 
      sites of these compounds that accounted for their remyelinating activity, 
      irrespective of their antioxidant action. CONCLUSION: Overall, edaravone emerges 
      as a candidate to treat complex disease such as MS, where inflammation, oxidative 
      stress and neurodegeneration contribute to disease progression, together or 
      individually, in different phases and disease types. Furthermore, approaches 
      based on drug repositioning seem to maintain the promise of helping discover 
      novel treatment for complex diseases, where molecular targets are largely 
      unknown.

TI  - Inhibitory Mechanism of An Anticancer Drug, Bexarotene Against Amyloid β Peptide 
      Aggregation: Repurposing Via Neuroinformatics Approach.
PG  - 2989-2995
LID - 10.2174/1381612825666190801123235 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aggregation of Amyloid β (Aβ) peptide is a crucial feature of 
      Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis. In fact, Aβ peptides are misfolded and 
      aggregated to frame Amyloid fibrils, which is considered as one of the major 
      contributing events in the onset of AD. All these observations have prompted the 
      researchers to design therapeutic molecules with robust anti-Aβ aggregation 
      potential. Interestingly, in the last few decades, drug repurposing has turned 
      into a fruitful and savvy approach for the treatment of several diseases. 
      Bexarotene is an anticancer drug that has been under consideration for its 
      ability to suppress Aβ-peptide aggregation. However, the exact mechanistic aspect 
      of suppression of Aβ-peptide accumulation has not yet been completely revealed. 
      METHODS: In the present study, we have attempted to decipher the mechanistic 
      aspects of the anti-aggregation potential of bexarotene by using the 
      computational biology approach. RESULTS: We have observed the effect of 
      'Aβ-bexarotene' interaction on the aggregation ability of the Aβ-peptide and 
      decoded the involvement of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) 
      and beta-secretase (BACE-1). A deep structural analysis of Aβ upon binding with 
      bexarotene revealed critical binding sites and structural twists involved in Aβ 
      aggregation. It is evident from the present that bexarotene could significantly 
      restrain the process of primary nucleation of Aβ. In addition, bexarotene showed 
      a strong interaction with RAGE and BACE-1, suggesting them as plausible targets 
      for the neuro-therapeutic action of bexarotene. CONCLUSION: Hence, we could 
      safely suggest that bexarotene is a potent drug candidate that could reduce Aβ- 
      peptide aggregation by applying different mechanistic pathways. These results 
      might boost the portfolio of pharmaceutical companies looking for the development 
      of new chemical entities against AD.

TI  - AI-DrugNet: A network-based deep learning model for drug repurposing and

AB  - Discovering effective therapies is difficult for neurological and developmental 
      disorders in that disease progression is often associated with a complex and 
      interactive mechanism. Over the past few decades, few drugs have been identified 
      for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially for impacting the causes of 
      cell death in AD. Although drug repurposing is gaining more success in developing 
      therapeutic efficacy for complex diseases such as common cancer, the 
      complications behind AD require further study. Here, we developed a novel 
      prediction framework based on deep learning to identify potential repurposed drug 
      therapies for AD, and more importantly, our framework is broadly applicable and 
      may generalize to identifying potential drug combinations in other diseases. Our 
      prediction framework is as follows: we first built a drug-target pair (DTP) 
      network based on multiple drug features and target features, as well as the 
      associations between DTP nodes where drug-target pairs are the DTP nodes and the 
      associations between DTP nodes are represented as the edges in the AD disease 
      network; furthermore, we incorporated the drug-target feature from the DTP 
      network and the relationship information between drug-drug, target-target, 
      drug-target within and outside of drug-target pairs, representing each 
      drug-combination as a quartet to generate corresponding integrated features; 
      finally, we developed an AI-based Drug discovery Network (AI-DrugNet), which 
      exhibits robust predictive performance. The implementation of our network model 
      help identify potential repurposed and combination drug options that may serve to 
      treat AD and other diseases.

AB  - Many of genes mediating Known Drug-Disease Association (KDDA) are escaped from 
      experimental detection. Identifying of these genes (hidden genes) is of great 
      significance for understanding disease pathogenesis and guiding drug repurposing. 
      Here, we presented a novel computational tool, called KDDANet, for systematic and 
      accurate uncovering the hidden genes mediating KDDA from the perspective of 
      genome-wide functional gene interaction network. KDDANet demonstrated the 
      competitive performances in both sensitivity and specificity of identifying genes 
      in mediating KDDA in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art methods. Case 
      studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and obesity uncovered the mechanistic 
      relevance of KDDANet predictions. Furthermore, when applied with multiple types 
      of cancer-omics datasets, KDDANet not only recapitulated known genes mediating 
      KDDAs related to cancer, but also revealed novel candidates that offer new 
      biological insights. Importantly, KDDANet can be used to discover the shared 
      genes mediating multiple KDDAs. KDDANet can be accessed at http://www.kddanet.cn 
      and the code can be freely downloaded at https://github.com/huayu1111/KDDANet .

AB  - Repurposing refers to the therapeutic use of a drug or drug candidate for a 
      disease other than that for which it was originally intended. Repurposing is 
      attractive as a drug development strategy since much is known about approved 
      agents including their drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic features, dosing, 
      safety, tolerability, formulation and manufacturing. Time savings are also robust 
      accounting for several years of the drug development cycle. Tissue and cell-based 
      assays, epidemiologic information and human studies identify approved drugs that 
      might be repurposed from use in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative 
      disorders. The total number of compounds available for repurposing that are 
      brain-penetrant is relatively small. Intellectual property and patent protection 
      issues for repurposed drugs are hurdles for this approach to drug development. 
      Repurposing may contribute importantly to development of new therapies for 
      neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that peripheral factors to the brain driving 
      neuro-inflammation could affect Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease 
      (PD) severity. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infection has been associated 
      with AD while other related viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Bar 
      virus and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), are known to infect neurons. Here we 
      compare gene expression profiles between AD or PD patients to those afflicted 
      with herpes viral infections as to discover novel potential neuro-inflammation 
      pathways. We found multiple significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
      shared between AD/PD and viral infections including SESN3 which has a genetic 
      association for increased AD risk. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed viruses 
      shared Oxidative Stress Defense System and LRRK2 pathways with AD and PD, 
      respectively. We further processed our data to identify novel target and 
      drug-repurposing opportunities including anti-inflammatory therapy, 
      immune-modulators and cholinesterase inhibitors which could lead to new 
      therapeutics paradigms for these neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Proximal Pathway Enrichment Analysis for Targeting Comorbid Diseases via Network 
      Endopharmacology.
LID - 10.3390/ph11030061 [doi]
LID - 61
AB  - The past decades have witnessed a paradigm shift from the traditional drug 
      discovery shaped around the idea of &ldquo;one target, one disease&rdquo; to 
      polypharmacology (multiple targets, one disease). Given the lack of clear-cut 
      boundaries across disease (endo)phenotypes and genetic heterogeneity across 
      patients, a natural extension to the current polypharmacology paradigm is to 
      target common biological pathways involved in diseases via endopharmacology 
      (multiple targets, multiple diseases). In this study, we present proximal pathway 
      enrichment analysis (PxEA) for pinpointing drugs that target common disease 
      pathways towards network endopharmacology. PxEA uses the topology information of 
      the network of interactions between disease genes, pathway genes, drug targets 
      and other proteins to rank drugs by their interactome-based proximity to pathways 
      shared across multiple diseases, providing unprecedented drug repurposing 
      opportunities. Using PxEA, we show that many drugs indicated for autoimmune 
      disorders are not necessarily specific to the condition of interest, but rather 
      target the common biological pathways across these diseases. Finally, we provide 
      high scoring drug repurposing candidates that can target common mechanisms 
      involved in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, two conditions that 
      have recently gained attention due to the increased comorbidity among patients.

      treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Drug repurposing is an efficient strategy for new drug discovery. Our latest 
      study found that nitazoxanide (NTZ), an approved anti-parasite drug, was an 
      autophagy activator and could alleviate the symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      In order to further improve the efficacy and discover new chemical entities, a 
      series of NTZ-based derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as 
      autophagy activator against AD. All compounds were screened by the inhibition of 
      phosphorylation of p70S6K, which was the direct substrate of mammalian target of 
      rapamycin (mTOR) and its phosphorylation level could reflect the mTOR-dependent 
      autophagy level. Among these analogs, compound 22 exhibited excellent potency in 
      promoting β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance, inhibiting tau phosphorylation, as well as 
      stimulating autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. What's more, 22 could 
      effectively improve the memory and cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 transgenic AD 
      model mice. These results demonstrated that 22 was a potential candidate for the 
      treatment of AD.

TI  - Inhibition of Microtubule Affinity Regulating Kinase 4 by Metformin: Exploring 
      the Neuroprotective Potential of Antidiabetic Drug through Spectroscopic and 
      Computational Approaches.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144652 [doi]
LID - 4652
AB  - Microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) regulates the mechanism of 
      microtubules by its ability to phosphorylate the microtubule-associated proteins 
      (MAP's). MARK4 is known for its major role in tau phosphorylation via 
      phosphorylating Ser(262) residue in the KXGS motif, which results in the 
      detachment of tau from microtubule. In lieu of this vital role in tau pathology, 
      a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), MARK4 is a druggable target to treat AD 
      and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). There is growing evidence that NDs 
      and diabetes are connected with many pieces of literature demonstrating a high 
      risk of developing AD in diabetic patients. Metformin (Mtf) has been a drug in 
      use against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for a long time; however, recent 
      studies have established its therapeutic effect in neurodegenerative diseases 
      (NDs), namely AD, Parkinson's disease (PD) and amnestic mild cognitive 
      impairment. In this study, we have explored the MARK4 inhibitory potential of 
      Mtf, employing in silico and in vitro approaches. Molecular docking demonstrated 
      that Mtf binds to MARK4 with a significant affinity of -6.9 kcal/mol forming 
      interactions with binding pocket's critical residues. Additionally, molecular 
      dynamics (MD) simulation provided an atomistic insight into the binding of Mtf 
      with MARK4. ATPase assay of MARK4 in the presence of Mtf shows that it inhibits 
      MARK4 with an IC(50) = 7.05 µM. The results of the fluorescence binding assay 
      demonstrated significant binding of MARK4 with a binding constant of 0.6 × 10(6) 
      M(-1). The present study provides an additional axis towards the utilization of 
      Mtf as MARK4 inhibitor targeting diabetes with NDs.

AB  - Alzheimer disease (AD) represents a major medical problem where mono-therapeutic 
      interventions demonstrated only a limited efficacy so far. We explored the 
      possibility of developing a combinational therapy that might prevent the 
      degradation of neuronal and endothelial structures in this disease. We argued 
      that the distorted balance between excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory 
      (GABA/glycine) systems constitutes a therapeutic target for such intervention. We 
      found that a combination of two approved drugs - acamprosate and baclofen - 
      synergistically protected neurons and endothelial structures in vitro against 
      amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers. The neuroprotective effects of these drugs were 
      mediated by modulation of targets in GABA/glycinergic and glutamatergic pathways. 
      In vivo, the combination alleviated cognitive deficits in the acute Aβ25-35 
      peptide injection model and in the mouse mutant APP transgenic model. Several 
      patterns altered in AD were also synergistically normalised. Our results open up 
      the possibility for a promising therapeutic approach for AD by combining 
      repurposed drugs.

TI  - Effects of Naodesheng tablets on amyloid beta-induced dysfunction: A traditional 
      Chinese herbal formula with novel therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease 
      revealed by systems pharmacology.

AB  - Naodesheng (NDS) tablets have been widely used to treat ischemic stroke 
      clinically. NDS relieves neurological function impairment and improve learning 
      and memory in rats with focal cerebral ischemia, suggesting that NDS has 
      potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. However, there are no studies 
      about its effective material basis and possible mechanisms. In this study, a 
      systems pharmacology method was applied to reveal the potential molecular 
      mechanism of NDS in the treatment of AD. First, we obtained 360 NDS candidate 
      constituents through ADMET filter analysis. Then, 115 AD-related targets were 
      uncovered by pharmacophore model prediction via mapping the predicted targets 
      against AD-related proteins. In addition, compound-target and target-function 
      networks were established to suggest potential synergistic effects among the 
      candidate constituents. Furthermore, potential targets regulated by NDS were 
      integrated into AD-related pathways to demonstrate the therapeutic mechanism of 
      NDS in AD treatment. Subsequently, a validation experiment proved the therapeutic 
      effect of NDS on cognitive dysfunction in rats with intracerebroventricular 
      injection of Aβ. We found that administration of NDS tablets regulates β-amyloid 
      metabolism, improves synaptic plasticity, inhibits neuroinflammation and improves 
      learning and memory function. In conclusion, this is the first study to provide a 
      comprehensive systems pharmacology approach to elucidate the potential 
      therapeutic mechanism of NDS tablets for AD treatment. We suggest that the 
      protective effects of NDS in neurodegenerative conditions could be partly 
      attributed to its role in improving synaptic plasticity and inhibiting 
      neuroinflammation via NF-κB signaling pathway inhibition and cAMP/PKA/CREB 
      signaling pathway activation.

TI  - Conversion from cilostazol to OPC-13015 linked to mitigation of cognitive

PG  - e12182
LID - 10.1002/trc2.12182 [doi]
LID - e12182
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cilostazol may be a novel therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's 
      disease. Its metabolite, OPC-13015, has a stronger inhibitory effect on type 3 
      phosphodiesterase than cilostazol. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients 
      with mild cognitive impairment to whom cilostazol was newly prescribed. Patients 
      underwent the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) twice, at a 6-month interval. 
      Plasma cilostazol, OPC-13015, OPC-13213, and OPC-13217 concentrations were 
      determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: MoCA 
      score changes from baseline to the 6-month visit were positively correlated with 
      ratios of OPC-13015 to cilostazol and total metabolites (n = 19, P = .005). 
      Patients with higher ratios of OPC-13015 (≥0.18, median value; n = 10) had 
      significantly higher MoCA scores (P = .036) than patients with lower ratios (the 
      ratio <0.18, n = 9). The absolute value of OPC-13015 concentration in blood was 
      also higher in patients with preserved cognitive function (P = .033). DISCUSSION: 
      Blood OPC-13015 levels may be a predictive biomarker of cilostazol treatment for 
      Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Computational Screening of Repurposed Drugs for HMG-CoA Synthase 2 in Alzheimer's 
      Disease.
LID - 10.3233/JAD-240376 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: HMGCS2 (mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-COA synthase 2) 
      plays a pivotal role as a control enzyme in ketogenesis, and its association with 
      the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) in mitochondria implicates a potential 
      involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: Our study 
      aimed at identifying repurposed drugs using the DrugBank database capable of 
      inhibiting HMGCS2 activity. METHODS: Exploiting the power of drug repurposing in 
      conjunction with virtual screening and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations against 
      'HMGCS2', we present new in-silico insight into structure-based drug repurposing. 
      RESULTS: The initial molecules were screened for their binding affinity to 
      HMGCS2. Subsequent interaction analyses and extensive 300 ns MD simulations were 
      conducted to explore the conformational dynamics and stability of HMGCS2 in 
      complex with the screened molecules, particularly Penfluridol and Lurasidone. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that HMGCS2 forms stable protein-ligand complexes 
      with Penfluridol and Lurasidone. Our findings indicate that Penfluridol and 
      Lurasidone competitively bind to HMGCS2 and warrant their further exploration as 
      potential repurposed molecules for anti-Alzheimer's drug development.

AB  - Background and objective: Background and objective: Drug repurposing has been 
      considered a cost-effective and reduced-risk strategy for developing new drugs. 
      Little is known and documented regarding the efficiency of repurposing strategies 
      in drug development. The objective of this article is to assess the extent and 
      meaning of this process in the CNS area. Methods: In order to identify repurposed 
      drugs that target the CNS, an extensive search was performed. For each identified 
      case, its initial and target indication, development status and the type of 
      repurposing strategy (repositioning, reformulation or both) was recorded. 
      Results: One hundred and eighteen source products were identified. They were 
      repurposed (mainly repositioned) 203 times with 81 products repurposed once and 
      38 products repurposed twice or more. The highest number of source drugs 
      originated from the CNS area. Alzheimer's disease was targeted most often. Half 
      of the new indications were approved. Regarding repurposing within the CNS area, 
      epilepsy, schizophrenia and depression were the richest sources of repurposed 
      drugs. Conclusions: Repurposing drugs into CNS is an efficient and very active 
      drug development method, exemplified by the considerable number of new 
      indications that have been found via this strategy, with approximately half of 
      the target indications currently under development.

LID - 100943
AB  - The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is correlated with the misfolding 
      and aggregation of amyloid-beta protein (Aβ). Here we report that the antibiotic 
      benzylpenicillin (BP) can specifically bind to Aβ, modulate the process of 
      aggregation and supress its cytotoxic effect, initially via a reversible binding 
      interaction, followed by covalent bonding between specific functional groups 
      (nucleophiles) within the Aβ peptide and the beta-lactam ring. Mass spectrometry 
      and computational docking supported covalent modification of Aβ by BP. BP was 
      found to inhibit aggregation of Aβ as revealed by the Thioflavin T (ThT) 
      fluorescence assay and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In addition, BP treatment 
      was found to have a cytoprotective activity against Aβ-induced cell cytotoxicity 
      as shown by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide 
      (MTT) cell toxicity assay. The specific interaction of BP with Aβ suggests the 
      possibility of structure-based drug design, leading to the identification of new 
      drug candidates against AD. Moreover, good pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam 
      antibiotics and safety on long-time use make them valuable candidates for drug 
      repurposing towards neurological disorders such as AD.

TI  - A cross-species analysis method to analyze animal models' similarity to human's 
      disease state.
PG  - S18

AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal models are indispensable tools in studying the cause of human 
      diseases and searching for the treatments. The scientific value of an animal 
      model depends on the accurate mimicry of human diseases. The primary goal of the 
      current study was to develop a cross-species method by using the animal models' 
      expression data to evaluate the similarity to human diseases' and assess drug 
      molecules' efficiency in drug research. Therefore, we hoped to reveal that it is 
      feasible and useful to compare gene expression profiles across species in the 
      studies of pathology, toxicology, drug repositioning, and drug action mechanism. 
      RESULTS: We developed a cross-species analysis method to analyze animal models' 
      similarity to human diseases and effectiveness in drug research by utilizing the 
      existing animal gene expression data in the public database, and mined some 
      meaningful information to help drug research, such as potential drug candidates, 
      possible drug repositioning, side effects and analysis in pharmacology. New 
      animal models could be evaluated by our method before they are used in drug 
      discovery. We applied the method to several cases of known animal model 
      expression profiles and obtained some useful information to help drug research. 
      We found that trichostatin A and some other HDACs could have very similar 
      response across cell lines and species at gene expression level. Mouse hypoxia 
      model could accurately mimic the human hypoxia, while mouse diabetes drug model 
      might have some limitation. The transgenic mouse of Alzheimer was a useful model 
      and we deeply analyzed the biological mechanisms of some drugs in this case. In 
      addition, all the cases could provide some ideas for drug discovery and drug 
      repositioning. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a new cross-species gene expression 
      module comparison method to use animal models' expression data to analyse the 
      effectiveness of animal models in drug research. Moreover, through data 
      integration, our method could be applied for drug research, such as potential 
      drug candidates, possible drug repositioning, side effects and information about 
      pharmacology.

TI  - Suppression of LPS-Induced Inflammation and Cell Migration by Azelastine through 
      Inhibition of JNK/NF-κB Pathway in BV2 Microglial Cells.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22169061 [doi]
LID - 9061
AB  - The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are implicated in many neuropathological 
      conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. To explore potential JNK3 
      inhibitors from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug library, we 
      performed structure-based virtual screening and identified azelastine (Aze) as 
      one of the candidates. NMR spectroscopy indicated its direct binding to the 
      ATP-binding site of JNK3, validating our observations. Although the antihistamine 
      effect of Aze is well documented, the involvement of the JNK pathway in its 
      action remains to be elucidated. This study investigated the effects of Aze on 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced JNK phosphorylation, pro-inflammatory mediators, 
      and cell migration in BV2 microglial cells. Aze was found to inhibit the 
      LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun. It also inhibited the LPS-induced 
      production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis 
      factor-α, and nitric oxide. Wound healing and transwell migration assays 
      indicated that Aze attenuated LPS-induced BV2 cell migration. Furthermore, Aze 
      inhibited LPS-induced IκB phosphorylation, thereby suppressing nuclear 
      translocation of NF-κB. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Aze exerts 
      anti-inflammatory and anti-migratory effects through inhibition of the JNK/NF-κB 
      pathway in BV2 cells. Based on our findings, Aze may be a potential candidate for 
      drug repurposing to mitigate neuroinflammation in various neurodegenerative 
      disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

TI  - High-throughput screening of the ReFRAME, Pandemic Box, and COVID Box drug 
      repurposing libraries against SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 endoribonuclease to identify 
      small-molecule inhibitors of viral activity.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic, and has taken over 1.7 million lives as 
      of mid-December, 2020. Although great progress has been made in the development 
      of effective countermeasures, with several pharmaceutical companies approved or 
      poised to deliver vaccines to market, there is still an unmet need of essential 
      antiviral drugs with therapeutic impact for the treatment of moderate-to-severe 
      COVID-19. Towards this goal, a high-throughput assay was used to screen 
      SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 uracil-dependent endonuclease (endoU) function against 13 
      thousand compounds from drug and lead repurposing compound libraries. While over 
      80% of initial hit compounds were pan-assay inhibitory compounds, three hits were 
      confirmed as nsp15 endoU inhibitors in the 1-20 μM range in vitro. Furthermore, 
      Exebryl-1, a ß-amyloid anti-aggregation molecule for Alzheimer's therapy, was 
      shown to have antiviral activity between 10 to 66 μM, in Vero 76, Caco-2, and 
      Calu-3 cells. Although the inhibitory concentrations determined for Exebryl-1 
      exceed those recommended for therapeutic intervention, our findings show great 
      promise for further optimization of Exebryl-1 as an nsp15 endoU inhibitor and as 
      a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral.

AB  - Understanding the genetic basis of biological aging in multi-organ systems is 
      vital for elucidating age-related disease mechanisms and identifying therapeutic 
      interventions. This study characterized the genetic architecture of the 
      biological age gap (BAG) across nine human organ systems in 377,028 individuals 
      of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. We discovered 393 genomic loci-BAG 
      pairs (P-value<5×10(-8)) linked to the brain, eye, cardiovascular, hepatic, 
      immune, metabolic, musculoskeletal, pulmonary, and renal systems. We observed 
      BAG-organ specificity and inter-organ connections. Genetic variants associated 
      with the nine BAGs are predominantly specific to the respective organ system 
      while exerting pleiotropic effects on traits linked to multiple organ systems. A 
      gene-drug-disease network confirmed the involvement of the metabolic 
      BAG-associated genes in drugs targeting various metabolic disorders. Genetic 
      correlation analyses supported Cheverud's Conjecture(1) - the genetic correlation 
      between BAGs mirrors their phenotypic correlation. A causal network revealed 
      potential causal effects linking chronic diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), 
      body weight, and sleep duration to the BAG of multiple organ systems. Our 
      findings shed light on promising therapeutic interventions to enhance human organ 
      health within a complex multi-organ network, including lifestyle modifications 
      and potential drug repositioning strategies for treating chronic diseases. All 
      results are publicly available at https://labs-laboratory.com/medicine.

AB  - There is growing recognition of cerebrovascular contributions to 
      neurodegenerative diseases. In the walls of cerebral arteries, amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
      accumulation is evident in a majority of aged people and patients with cerebral 
      amyloid angiopathy. Here, we leverage human pluripotent stem cells to generate 
      vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from neural crest progenitors, recapitulating 
      brain-vasculature-specific attributes of Aβ metabolism. We confirm that the 
      lipoprotein receptor, LRP1, functions in our neural-crest-derived SMCs to mediate 
      Aβ uptake and intracellular lysosomal degradation. Hypoxia significantly 
      compromises the contribution of SMCs to Aβ clearance by suppressing LRP1 
      expression. This enabled us to develop an assay of Aβ uptake by using the neural 
      crest-derived SMCs with hypoxia as a stress paradigm. We then tested several 
      vascular protective compounds in a high-throughput format, demonstrating the 
      value of stem-cell-based phenotypic screening for novel therapeutics and drug 
      repurposing, aimed at alleviating amyloid burden.

LID - 10.1080/07391102.2018.1526115 [doi]
AB  - Targeting beta-secretase 1, also known as beta-amyloid precursor protein-cleaving 
      enzyme (BACE-1) for the inhibition of amyloid production, has been intensely 
      studied in the last decades in the search for stopping Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      progression. The chances of finding a druggable BACE-1 inhibitor may be increased 
      by drug repurposing, as this kind of molecules already fulfil certain 
      requirements needed for further advancement. The study describes the development 
      and application of a data-mining method based on molecular frameworks and 
      descriptor values of tested BACE-1 inhibitors, suitable for filtering large 
      compound databases, in order to find molecules with high potency against this 
      protease. A total of 465 compounds extracted from the literature, tested against 
      BACE-1, were analysed for finding molecular descriptor values and frameworks that 
      ensure a high probability of strong inhibition. Resulting conclusions were used 
      for filtering DrugBank database, containing ∼8700 approved and experimental 
      drugs, obtaining 26 structures characterized by four major Bemis-Murcko 
      frameworks: 2-[3-(2-cyclohexylethyl)cyclohexyl]-decahydronaphthalene, 
      3-(2-cyclohexylethyl)-1,1'-bi(cyclohexane), 
      [5-(cyclohexylmethyl)-8-cyclopentyloctyl]cyclohexane and 
      (3-cyclohexylcyclopentyl)cyclohexane. The compounds were further studied by 
      molecular docking using the structure of the closed form of the enzyme, which 
      revealed seven compounds already involved in trials targeting BACE-1 inhibition, 
      confirming the method's specificity. The compounds that afforded the best binding 
      energies were DB06925 (tyrosine-protein kinase inhibitor), DB12285 (Verubecestat) 
      and DB08899 (Enzalutamide). Moreover, docking results indicated several other 
      molecules with high in silico inhibitory potency that can be further studied for 
      developing a potential treatment for AD. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

TI  - In Search for Low-Molecular-Weight Ligands of Human Serum Albumin That Affect Its 
      Affinity for Monomeric Amyloid β Peptide.

LID - 4975
AB  - An imbalance between production and excretion of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in the 
      brain tissues of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients leads to Aβ accumulation and 
      the formation of noxious Aβ oligomers/plaques. A promising approach to AD 
      prevention is the reduction of free Aβ levels by directed enhancement of Aβ 
      binding to its natural depot, human serum albumin (HSA). We previously 
      demonstrated the ability of specific low-molecular-weight ligands (LMWLs) in HSA 
      to improve its affinity for Aβ. Here we develop this approach through a 
      bioinformatic search for the clinically approved AD-related LMWLs in HSA, 
      followed by classification of the candidates according to the predicted location 
      of their binding sites on the HSA surface, ranking of the candidates, and 
      selective experimental validation of their impact on HSA affinity for Aβ. The top 
      100 candidate LMWLs were classified into five clusters. The specific 
      representatives of the different clusters exhibit dramatically different 
      behavior, with 3- to 13-fold changes in equilibrium dissociation constants for 
      the HSA-Aβ40 interaction: prednisone favors HSA-Aβ interaction, mefenamic acid 
      shows the opposite effect, and levothyroxine exhibits bidirectional effects. 
      Overall, the LMWLs in HSA chosen here provide a basis for drug repurposing for AD 
      prevention, and for the search of medications promoting AD progression.

TI  - Machine Learning Based Prediction of COVID-19 Mortality Suggests Repositioning of 
      Anticancer Drug for Treating Severe Cases.
PG  - 100020
LID - 10.1016/j.ailsci.2021.100020 [doi]
AB  - Despite available vaccinations COVID-19 case numbers around the world are still 
      growing, and effective medications against severe cases are lacking. In this 
      work, we developed a machine learning model which predicts mortality for COVID-19 
      patients using data from the multi-center 'Lean European Open Survey on 
      SARS-CoV-2-infected patients' (LEOSS) observational study (>100 active sites in 
      Europe, primarily in Germany), resulting into an AUC of almost 80%. We showed 
      that molecular mechanisms related to dementia, one of the relevant predictors in 
      our model, intersect with those associated to COVID-19. Most notably, among these 
      molecules was tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), a protein that has been patented as drug 
      target in Alzheimer's Disease but also genetically associated with severe 
      COVID-19 outcomes. We experimentally verified that anti-cancer drugs Sorafenib 
      and Regorafenib showed a clear anti-cytopathic effect in Caco2 and VERO-E6 cells 
      and can thus be regarded as potential treatments against COVID-19. Altogether, 
      our work demonstrates that interpretation of machine learning based risk models 
      can point towards drug targets and new treatment options, which are strongly 
      needed for COVID-19.

TI  - Novel Tadalafil Derivatives Ameliorates Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive Impairment 
      in Mice via Inhibition of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Phosphodiesterase 5 
      (PDE5).
PG  - 1625-1636

AB  - On the basis of the drug-repositioning and redeveloping strategy, 
      first-generation dual-target inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
      phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) have been recently reported as a potentially novel 
      therapeutic method for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the lead 
      compound 2 has proven this method was feasible in AD mouse models. In this study, 
      our work focused on exploring alternative novel tadalafil derivatives (3a-s). 
      Among the 19 analogues, compound 3c exhibited good selective dual-target 
      AChE/PDE5 inhibition and good blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Moreover, 
      its citrate (3c·Cit) possessed improved water solubility and good effects against 
      scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment with inhibition of cortical AChE 
      activities and enhancement of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) 
      phosphorylation ex vivo.

AB  - cAMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4 A (PDE4A) holds a pivotal role in 
      modulating intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). 
      Targeting PDE4A with novel therapeutic agents shows promise in addressing 
      neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases), mood 
      disorders (depression, anxiety), inflammatory conditions (asthma, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease), and even cancer. In this study, we present a 
      comprehensive approach that integrates virtual screening and molecular dynamics 
      (MD) simulations to identify potential inhibitors of PDE4A from the existing pool 
      of FDA-approved drugs. The initial compound selection was conducted focusing on 
      binding affinity scores, which led to the identification of several high-affinity 
      compounds with potential PDE4A binding properties. From the refined selection 
      process, two promising compounds, Fluspirilene and Dihydroergocristine, emerged 
      as strong candidates, displaying substantial affinity and specificity for the 
      PDE4A binding site. Interaction analysis provided robust evidence of their 
      binding capabilities. To gain deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of 
      Fluspirilene and Dihydroergocristine in complex with PDE4A, we conducted 300 ns 
      MD simulations, principal components analysis (PCA), and free energy landscape 
      (FEL) analysis. These analyses revealed that Fluspirilene and Dihydroergocristine 
      binding stabilized the PDE4A structure and induced minimal conformational 
      changes, highlighting their potential as potent binders. In conclusion, our study 
      systematically explores repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs as PDE4A 
      inhibitors through a comprehensive virtual screening pipeline. The identified 
      compounds, Fluspirilene and Dihydroergocristine, exhibit a strong affinity for 
      PDE4A, displaying characteristics that support their suitability for further 
      development as potential therapeutic agents for conditions associated with PDE4A 
      dysfunction.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Development of drugs for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), is thought to be a complicated problem of current 
      medical chemistry. According to current concepts, AD is proteinopathy due to 
      impairments in the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein and tau-protein that 
      results in the pathological protein aggregation in the brain. The author 
      describes about 130 compound used in clinical trials of AD in 2015 and presents 
      major characteristics of their action. It has allowed to find the following 
      trends in a search for drugs for AD: 1. Development of disease modifying drugs, 
      2. Drugs, which act on several molecular targets simultaneously, 3. Search for 
      new possibilities of using known drugs (drug reposition).

TI  - A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial for cilostazol in patients 
      with mild cognitive impairment: The COMCID study protocol.
PG  - 250-257
LID - 10.1016/j.trci.2016.10.001 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are currently no effective treatments preventing conversion 
      from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease. Cilostazol is a 
      selective type-3 phosphodiesterase inhibitor that ameliorates accumulation of 
      amyloid-β and has prevented cognitive decline in rodent models. Furthermore, 
      cilostazol is known to suppress platelet aggregation, protect vascular 
      endothelia, dilate vessels, and increase cerebral blood flow. Beneficial effects 
      have also been shown in observational cohort studies, demonstrating the need for 
      a prospective clinical trial. METHODS: The Cilostazol for prevention of 
      COnversion from MCI to Dementia (COMCID) study is a double-blind, randomized 
      phase II study of patients with MCI. Participants will receive cilostazol or 
      placebo for 96 weeks. The primary objective is to evaluate whether cilostazol 
      slows down cognitive decline measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination. 
      Secondary objectives are assessing time to conversion from MCI to dementia and 
      assessing incremental changes in several psychological assessment scales. 
      DISCUSSION: The COMCID trial will identify the therapeutic potential of 
      cilostazol. This trial, which is based on a drug repositioning strategy, may aid 
      the development of a neurovascular treatment for neurocognitive disorders.

      Alzheimers disease with excisting diabetic drugs.
PG  - 229-242
LID - 10.1007/s40200-019-00405-2 [doi]
AB  - Late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among 
      elderly. The exact cause of the disease is until now unknown and there is no 
      complete cure for the disease. Growing evidence suggest that AD is a metabolic 
      disorder associated with impairment in brain insulin signalling. These findings 
      enriched the scope for the repurposing of diabetic drugs in AD management. Even 
      though many of these drugs are moving in a positive direction in the ongoing 
      clinical studies, the extent of the success has seen to influence by several 
      properties of these drugs since they were originally designed to manage the 
      peripheral insulin resistance. In depth understandings of these properties is 
      hence highly significant to optimise the use of diabetic drugs in the clinical 
      management of AD; which is the primary aim of the present review article.

TI  - Mining Clinical Case Reports to Identify New Lines of Investigation in 
      Alzheimer's Disease: The Curious Case of DNase I.
PG  - 71-76
LID - 10.3233/ADR-190100 [doi]
AB  - Mining the case report literature identified an intriguing, yet neglected 
      finding: Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's 
      disease. This finding is speculative, both because it is based on one patient, 
      and because the underlying mechanism(s) of action remain obscure. However, 
      further literature review revealed that there are several plausible mechanisms by 
      which DNase I might affect the course of Alzheimer's disease. Given that DNase I 
      is an FDA-approved drug, with extensive studies in both animals and man in the 
      context of other diseases, I suggest that investigation of DNAse I in Alzheimer's 
      disease is worthwhile.
